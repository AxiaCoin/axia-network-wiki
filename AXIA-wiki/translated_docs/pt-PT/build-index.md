Welcome to the builders section of the AXIA wiki.

Here you will be able to find the most up-to-date information on the status of the development tools in the AXIA ecosystem. We are always adding new tools and frameworks as we learn about them so if you are working on something that should be included please reach out to us on [Riot](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#AXIA-watercooler:matrix.org).

This section of the wiki is divided into the following parts:

## Development Guide

- [Starter's Guide](build-build-with-AXIA) - High level overview on choosing a allychain, parathread, or smart contract for your project and how to get started.
- [Allychain Development Kits](build-pdk) - PDKs are toolkits for building allychains and parathreads.
- [Smart Contracts](build-smart-contracts) - Smart contracts are fragments of custom logic that can be deployed to a live chain.

## Integration Guide

This section is for service providers like wallets or node operators who want to learn how to integrate AXIA into their systems.

- [AXIA Protocol Information](build-protocol-info) - General information and F.A.Q.s about the AXIA protocol, e.g. address formats.
- [Node Management](build-node-management) - A short overview of the Axia AXIA client and the most relevant options/flags for infrastructure providers.
- [Node Interaction](build-node-interaction) - Learn how to interact with your node via RPC.
