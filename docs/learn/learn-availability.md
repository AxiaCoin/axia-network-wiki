The AXIA Foundation is neither a market, nor a state. It is neither the embodiment of capitalism, nor socialism. It is not trapped by history, mythology or any of the standard paradigms that people reflexively attach to blockchain projects. The mission of the AXIA Foundation is to birth and foster the development of the most trusted and secure, ever-expanding ecosystem, and the creation of a digital currency (AXIA Coin) that is the preeminent medium of exchange around the world. As such, the AXIA Foundation operates as a non-profit organization, with the guiding principle that all activities and operations undertaken by the AXIA Foundation are in place to support AXIA Coin, the AXIA Network, AXIA Ecosystem and the community. The core values of the AXIA Foundation as follows:
### Transparency
The AXIA Foundation recognizes that its preeminent goal is the establishment of public trust between AXIA and the global citizens. It is therefore a necessity that AXIA provide complete and total transparency surrounding its operations in order to fulfill its mission of supplanting traditional forms of currency and destructive corporate structures. 
### Inclusion
AXIA is for all people everywhere, regardless of socio-economic status, nationality, race, gender, creed, religion, political affiliation or system of beliefs. All activities associated with the usage of AXIA Coin will be public to the community. 
### Value
The AXIA Foundation will seek to create an operating model that always maintains scarcity of AXIA Coin and provides value back to the AXIA Ecosystem and community. The Foundation will not seek to build empires for the sake of power or influence, the power resides in the hands of the community members. Its core decree will be to ensure and uphold trust within the AXIA community, while remaining committed to consistently delivering value back to AXIA Coin holders and creating positive social impact on the world.
### Partnership
While the design of AXIA Coin is unique within the blockchain industry, the AXIA Foundation will not be an isolated island unto itself. It will seek to partner and participate with other projects, corporations, institutions, organizations and individuals that share the same values. The AXIA Foundation will continuously seek opportunities to work with global partners to integrate in the AXIA Ecosystem and utilize AXIA Coin as a preferred medium of exchange, as well as into a wide variety of financial, technological and social applications, to support the AXIA community.

The AXIA Foundation is committed to providing complete operational transparency, and will publicly report all network activity and project information in real-time to strengthen trust between AXIA and the community. As such, the AXIA Foundation has entered into agreements with trusted third parties to meet the following organizational requirements: 
1. A public reviewablereporting structure is in place for both the operations and holdings of the AXIA Treasury 
2. Independent third parties are running master nodes on the blockchain so as to confirm the validity of the transactions taking place therein and that these transactions are publicly disclosed to the AXIA community. 

The AXIA Foundation will act as stewards of the decentralized framework that has been established. It will ensure the transparency, utility and security that AXIA Coin holders will desire for their currency and an ecosystem of innovative services, offerings, applications, resources, operations and endeavors that will continue to grow over time. The AXIA Foundation has formed – and will continue to establish – connections with leading technology and security experts to ensure the technological architecture of the AXIA Network, AXIA Ecosystem and AXIA Coin evolve as everyday requirements change.
