## What is Nomination ?
Nomination is the process of staking AXCs to a validator to support a network while receiving a reward in return. A nominator can select a particular validator from the validator list and nominate them by staking their AXC Coins. When they do so, they are vouching for that specific validator, and the nomination is a signal of trust in the AXIA Network. When nominating, tokens are deducted instantly and added to the total amount staked by the nominator.


:::note A nominator should know

* What is Node ID? 

-> Node ID is an identifier for a node in an remote server's address space. With these Node ID a nominator can identify the validator.

* What is Validator Stake?

-> The maximum weight of a validator (their own stake + stake nominated to them)  5 times stake of validator (min is 100,000), max can be based on stake of a validator * 5.

* What is "No. of Nominator"?
 
-> Number of AXC holders, who are stake their AXC to a particular Validator.

* What is End Time? 

-> End Time is the remaining validation period for a validator.

* What is Fee? 

-> Fee for a nominator is how much you have to pay to the network from your gained reward.
