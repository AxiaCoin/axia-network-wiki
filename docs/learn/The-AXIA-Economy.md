## AXIA Tokenomics

AXIA is introducing a proprietary monetary model that combines a number of economic features that provide unique benefits to users of the AXIA Coin. 

AXIA is the first ever hyper-deflationary network with a digital currency that created the means to provide real-time transparency of its treasury holdings and all network activity. 

All the rewards generated from the applications, platforms and businesses on the AXIA Network and within the AXIA Ecosystem have been architected to ensure that any of the decentralized activity will further support and strengthen the AXIA Network.

With AXIA being a non-profit, the network and ecosystem function as a distributed and decentralized stakeholder model. The users of AXIA Coin have a true stake in not only all the extensive utility offered with AXIA Coin  but share in the benefits of each of the applications, platforms and business along with the network itself. So, if an individual is a participant in the AXIA community then the rewards that are generated in the ecosystem are for themselves and others at the same time. The hyper-deflationary AXIA Network offers a higher level of decentralization, it removes barriers to entry and can generate more productivity for all who participate and use AXIA Coin. 

With AXIA everyone has a stake in a whole economy. An economy that is decentralized, which can potentially continue to expand, increasing the benefits for the AXIA community over time. 

The innovative tokenomics for the network are on full display to the public as there is visibility of the constant decrease in Total Supply of AXIA Coin which makes it more and more scarce over time, while simultaneously there is the ability to view how the AXIA Treasury may strengthen at the same time. The AXIA Treasury has been established to give an additional layer of support to the AXIA Network, AXIA Coin and all the participants. 

The unique combination of a coin supply that reduces through coin burning from certain mechanisms such as participating, staking and other activities, along with a treasury that has the possibility to offer more and more support with total visibility to the market. These proprietary tokenomics are enabled through a variety of smart contracts built into the decentralized AXIA Network.

Wherever possible, third-parties have been utilized to review, report and audit on the viability of the network, the economics, the reporting tools utilized and smart contracts put in place to ensure security, transparency, reliability and credibility is always in place.  

AXIA delivers an innovative monetary policy and economic design. Not only do the participants have a stake in the network as well as all the rewards and produce, but these rewards and benefits are distributed amongst all the participants.This design is far more decentralized than other organizations that have a dependency on smaller groups of individuals, and in which the rewards only go to a select few. AXIA can truly decentralize our economy for the benefit of everyone. 


## AXIA Coin Burning

The coin burning mechanism is facilitated from a variety of inputs that can only increase in velocity knowing the great potential of continued expansion of the AXIA Network and AXIA Ecosystem continue to expand. 

The AXIA Coin Burning Smart Contract ensures that coins are burned from the Total Supply when any of the following six events happens:

1. When AXIA Coin is acquired inside the AXIA Ecosystem, an equivalent amount is burned
2. When AXIA Coin is placed in a staking pool, an equivalent amount is burned
3. When AXIA Coin daily rewards are generated in a staking pool, an equivalent amount is burned
4. When AXIA Coin is released from a staking pool at the end of a term, an equivalent amount is burned
5. 100% of the network fees paid in AXIA Coin during block creation and validation of transactions is burned       
6. When other activity on the network or in the ecosystem generates proceeds or an eligible fee, AXIA Coin is burned. For example:  
       * Upon use of an AXpay, the associated transaction fee is generated and the equivalent amount of that fee is burned
       * If a user generates fees through the use of an ecosystem app or platform such as AXplorer or AXclusive, then the equivalent amount is burned 

:::note

As proceeds are generated from the AXIA Ecosystem applications, platforms and businesses as well as from associated partnerships, a corresponding amount of AXIA Coins will also be burned.

With this structure, AXIA Coins will constantly be burned with virtually every interaction or activity on the network and within the ecosystem as the AXIA Treasury can be providing stronger support simultaneously, which could consistently produce benefits for the AXIA Network over time. All this is occurring through the decentralized activity of AXIA participants. Going forward, additional coin burning trigger events may be added if deemed appropriate. 

There is an assurance that AXIA Coin will increase the rate of coin burning over time ensuring that the coin becomes more and more rare. This constant reduction in supply not only may reinforce the network and its native coin, but exemplifies how the economic model of the AXIA Coin is anti-dilutive. This is especially beneficial for those participating in staking.

The tokenomics for AXIA run in complete contrast to the alternative currencies that institute a monetary policy in which there is the capacity to mint more currency whether by a centralized organization or based on specified parameters in decentralized systems. This means the total supply of these instruments - from cryptocurrencies to fiat currencies - are essentially infinite.

Monetary theorists have proposed that minting/printing more currency increases productivity for an economy. As explained this has been proven false specifically by the debt-based sovereign currency models that are in place today. Additionally, this has not removed the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies. Though there have been many advancements in technology over the last decades, productivity has not grown proportionally. 

Inflationary monetary policies where currency can be minted at any time in whatever amount have proven to result in not only the loss of purchasing power, hence loss in value, but also yielded minimal or no significant increase in productivity. These policies establish a system of wealth concentration and unfairness and in the case of sovereign currencies are also due to a dependence on debt. 

The architecture of the AXIA tokenomics is specifically based on having a decentralized model that increases productivity across the board without the need for anyone to sacrifice. One where there will be opportunity for all individuals to benefit themselves and others simultaneously as well as increase efficiency and productivity for businesses.
