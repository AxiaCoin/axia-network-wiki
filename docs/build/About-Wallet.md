## Introduction
AXIA is a platform for Decentralized Applications that aims to enhance scalability, interoperability, and usability within its three chains. If you want to explore and interact with the AXIA ecosystem and DApps, you’ll need an AXIA Wallet.

## What is an AXIA Wallet? 
AXIA Wallet is a non-custodial cryptocurrency browser wallet for interacting with the AXIA ecosystem. You can store, transfer, and stake AXIA Coins, and even create your own NFTs (non-fungible tokens).
As mentioned, the AXIA network features three types of blockchains: the Swap Chain , the AX Chain , and the Core Chain . The Swap Chain is a decentralized platform for creating and trading the AXIA native token AXC. The AX Chain allows users to create smart contracts and interact with DApps and DeFi services. The Core Chain coordinates network validators and can be used for staking on the AXIA Wallet.

## How does an AXIA Web Wallet work?
You can store AXCs on any of the three chains to serve different purposes. Take AXC as an example: it can be stored and traded on the Swap Chain, used on the AX Chain to pay for transaction fees and interact with smart contracts, or staked on the Core Chain to earn rewards. This might sound complicated at first, but you can easily move tokens from one chain to another using the cross-chain function of the AXIA Wallet.
Note that each chain has its own wallet address and format. The Swap Chain wallet addresses all start with “Swap”, while the Core Chain addresses begin with “Core”. The AX Chain addresses start with a “0”, similar to Ethereum addresses.

To transfer tokens to and from your AXIA Wallet, you should select the corresponding chain address. For example, MetaMask wallets are only compatible with the AX Chain. Be careful and make sure to double-check the addresses before making transactions. You may lose your funds if you send tokens to an incompatible network.
