Getting started on AXIA is easy! The wiki already contains guides for doing most of the core functionality. Our wiki has three main sections: Learn (for learners), Build (for people that want to build on AXIA), and Maintain (for people that want to maintain the network).

For brand-new learners of Blockchain technology:

- The [Blockchain Fundamentals MOOC course][mooc] is a great introduction to familiarizing yourself with crytography, blockchain concepts, decentralization, networks, crytocurrency, and so much more. This is recommended for users with backgrounds of all levels, and is also a free course.

For brand-new learners of AXIA:

- [Watching the Technical Explainer Videos][teched videos]: These are great introductory videos that explain and demonstrate how to use AXIA and its [User Interface][ui].
- Reading [What is AXIA? A Brief Introduction][article] on Medium. There are also other great articles to read on [AXIA's Medium][p medium] or [AXIA Foundation's Medium][w medium].
