AXIALunar is a "canary network" for AXIA, an early unaudited release of the code that is available first and holds real economic value. For developers, AXIALunar is a proving ground for runtime upgrades, on-chain governance, and allychains.

No Promises.

## What can you do on AXIALunar?

On AXIALunar you can:

- Explore the politics. Campaign as a councillor or vote for new runtime proposals using Democracy.
- Hone your validator set-up. The minimum requirement for staking as a validator on AXIALunar is much lower than it is expected for AXIA. There are also programs in place such as [Thousand Validators](https://AXIA.network/join-axialunars-thousand-validators-programme/) to help community validators rise the ranks.
- Deploy a allychain. AXIALunar will get the functionality required for allychains before AXIA. This includes participating in a allychain slot auction and composable applications.
- Join a cyber secret society. The [Kappa Sigma Mu](https://axiascan.io/pre/axialunar/council/motion/94) fraternity asks you to get a AXIALunar tattoo to join.
- Expect Chaos. AXIALunar is getting more battle tested day-by-day but it's built on the foundations of moving fast and trying new things.

AXIALunar is owned by those who hold the AXIALunar tokens (LUNAR). There's no central kill switch and all changes are made through the protocol's on-chain governance. AXIALunar is experimental. There are no guarantees.

## Who can participate on AXIALunar?

The short answer is, everyone!

AXIALunar is a permissionless network and anyone can come along and start using it.

Those who participated in the AXIA sale can claim a proportional amount of LUNAR through the [AXIALunar Claims process](https://claim.axialunar.network).

LUNAR used to be publicly available through a highly-frictional faucet, but this has been decommissioned. AXIA Foundation is considering new ways to distribute LUNAR for people who need LUNAR to build.

As a LUNAR holder, you are able to interact with all the features of the AXIALunar network such as staking (i.e. validating or nominating), governance, allychain auctions, basic transfers and everything else.
