The monetary policy of AXIA is controlled by code, not a few people in a boardroom. Unlike fiat currencies, AXIA has a Total Supply that has already been established which can only reduce over time. There will never be more AXIA Coins minted than the Total Supply. And the Total Supply can only decrease, never increase. 

There will be the continual diminishment of Total Supply occurring through coin burning from any form of participation, staking and activity. This will be confirmed by a network consensus protocol with block rewards being distributed in the native network coin, AXIA Coin.

In addition to offering a more efficient and cost effective ability to move AXIA Coins from wallet-to-wallet, across the globe, the AXIA Network will actively support a variety of use cases and innovative services, products and platforms so that global participants, businesses and projects continue to flourish within the community.

## AXIA Coin Total Supply will never go up

While the Circulating Supply, Total Supply, Staked Supply and Burned Supply may vary at any one time, what is unequivocal, indisputable and immutable is that the Total Supply will never go up, only down. There will never be more coins minted than the Initial Total Supply.


When a participant acquires AXIA Coin it can be taken from Total Supply. 

 
When this occurs an equivalent amount of AXIA Coin will be burned, thus increasing the Total Burned Supply.  

Additionally, should a participant choose to stake AXIA Coin this will increase the Total Staked Supply and raise the Total Burned Supply even more with a commensurate amount of AXIA Coin permanently removed from Total Supply. Furthermore, there will be an equivalent amount burned based on the staking rewards generated daily. On top of this at the end of the staking term, again an equivalent amount will be burned reducing Total Supply that much more.

It should be noted that the burning mechanism implemented for the acquisition of coin and staking will result in the possibility of the Fully Diluted Total Supply going down in amount. This can exemplify how there can be a negative correlation of the  Circulating Supply, Staked Supply and the Fully Diluted Total Supply based on the constant burning of coins through various activities. 

Individuals will be able to easily assess AXIA Coin data relative to alternatives. This is due to the overall transparency of information displayed to the market. It will simplify the capability to make informed decisions in a fraction of the time that it might take to draw conclusions about other projects. These unique fundamentals will speak for themselves.


## AXIA aims to remove the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies

AXIA Coins were pre-committed to founding team members, strategic advisors and early adopters prior to the launch of the AXIA Network and its native coin being open to the open market. AXIA is a project that is supported by a respected international team that has diverse professional backgrounds, including experience in application development, blockchain and software engineering, finance and marketing, and more. AXIA is a non-profit organization and is a self-funded project from the contributions of the early adopters. The funds contributed have been and will continue to be utilized to further develop of the ever expanding AXIA Network and Ecosystem as well as for the upgrades, expansion maintenance, administration and development and implementation of strategic partnerships and awareness campaigns that will assist to ensure the widespread global adoption of the decentralized AXIA Network. AXIA will continue to promote a participatory inclusionary network and economic model by inviting new participants to assist with new developments and the strategic direction of the overall AXIA Network to be able to maximize the positive impact AXIA can have on the world at large.

The early adopters also ensured that any new participant is benefiting from the decentralized hyper-deflationary economic model that creates rewards and benefits for themselves and others.    

The contributions made by early adopters were made based on a strong belief in the project vision as well as sharing the desire to provide positive social impact around the world. Knowing the potential the AXIA Network can unleash, the motivation from the outset was to make the network that offers the most inclusive decentralized economic model to date and removes barriers to entry for all to join, as well as providing a native coin that establishes a better more secure alternative that has the potential to be the most preferred medium of exchange that has ever come into existence. This is due to the deep understanding of the participatory, inclusionary hyper-deflationary economic model and not only the potential protective measures it provides, but also the means it provides to create benefits and rewards for everyone in the AXIA community over time.  

This ensures the [AXIA Treasury](../learn/The-AXIA-Treasury.md) will already have an established, verifiable, calculable value that would immediately support the AXIA Network. 

This structure further fulfills the collective goal of bringing an even more favorable alternative to the market to encourage people from all over the world to participate, continually building the community and expanding the network and its ecosystem. The more the community builds the network and the ecosystem continues to expand, the more benefits stand to be created for everyone as it only adds velocity to the hyper-deflationary economics.
