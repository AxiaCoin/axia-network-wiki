The AXIA Ecosystem is a true representation of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. 

The AXIA Ecosystem is the fusion of all the related AXIA applications, platforms and services, and how they interact with each other using blockchain technology, both within the AXIA Network and out in the world. The ecosystem goes well beyond just one application. The interrelated applications and services each play a separate, but similarly important role in the overall operation of the AXIA Network and AXIA Coin itself.

The applications, use cases, businesses and organizations that are connected on the AXIA Network within the AXIA Ecosystem are in place to deliver significant rewards to AXIA community members through decentralized activity and to provide positive social impact upon people around the world. The number of applications, services, functions, operations, activities and other offerings that will both directly and indirectly utilize AXIA Coin is designed to increase over time, so as to help ensure that participants have no reason to ever leave the ecosystem. And the more applications and platforms that are brought on to the network and into the AXIA Ecosystem, the more opportunities to create scarcity will present themselves.

There is a linkage to all people who participate in an economy. In the current competitive landscape few receive benefits, even though participation by the many is so crucial. With AXIA, the guiding principle will be to offer more decentralization and distributed benefits which can generate greater elements of collaboration. 

AXIA offers a sustainable and collaborative ecosystem involving users, entrepreneurs, inventors and developers. Ownership, governance and control is distributed amongst those who participate. Each use case is shared by everyone and the rewards will continue to accrue for all participants in the community. The ability to introduce natively created, transparent decentralized applications that everyone can trust and benefit from will move us away from the cut-throat, competitive, resource constrained, zero-sum mindset towards positive-sum endeavors. There are no constraints on the productivity, success and abundance that can be achieved by participants.

AXIA offers an inclusionary model where all are invited to participate, and where mechanisms are in place to support creation and advancement of ideas, designs and innovations. The entire AXIA community will reap the rewards from all developments on the network and within the ecosystem. AXIA maximizes the rewards individuals can receive from the things that they do every single day thereby bringing about more benefits for others. An essential element of the economic design of AXIA will be that it encourages a collective and enhanced benefit from the success of others, because if other adopters of the AXIA Network succeed, the benefits can grow for everyone. The number of AXIA use cases is virtually limitless, and there is a mandate to never stop pursuing new innovations and offerings to the community.
