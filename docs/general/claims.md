Around the world rising general economic inequality within countries can be traced back to the 1970’s. In 1971, the Nixon administration, burdened by international debt, broke the Bretton Woods commitment to redeem dollars for gold. This gave birth to the modern monetary system.This monetary system created the greatest wealth transfer in history. At the same time it has also destroyed ninety seven percent (97%) of purchasing power of the US dollar since 1913 - our current reserve currency. This also brought about an enormous amount of deficits for individuals, companies and governments alike and set the world on a course to complete and total economic devastation.
The break from Bretton Woods brought about the end to any hope of prosperity for all. Though there has always been inequality in the economy since that moment in time it only has gotten worse and worse.
# How central banks have destroyed purchasing power
* Prior to the 1970’s productivity in the economy would lead to growth, increased average wages and savings in the bank. But in the decades since, savings for the average person have disappeared and incomes have stagnated as those running the central banks have destroyed purchasing power year by year.
* In addition to their inflationary management of the money supply, central banks have contributed to the destruction of purchasing power through the regular and widespread use of asset purchase programs since 2008. These programs serve to expand the money supply in order to reflate activity, and have supported steep increases in asset prices, including a dizzying rise in the price of real estate globally. As a result the purchasing power of income has further fallen against basics such as shelter, with the growth of real estate prices outpacing the growth of stagnating incomes. 

* This, slowly over time, almost imperceptibly allowed wealth inequality to grow so much that today the wealthiest one percent (1%) own more than fifteen times that of the bottom fifty percent (50%). 

* The system works well for those who already have accumulated wealth. But for the rest, the odds are so stacked against success that the whole system feels rigged.

* Historically, poverty has been a leading contributor to social unrest. The best way to address poverty is to have policies, structures and programs in place that institute the proper means to not only prevent, but assist those who have fallen into the perils of this hardship.
That simply does not exist today. The numbers speak for themselves. Things are not getting better, they are only getting worse.     

* Currently people lose purchasing power by leaving money in the bank. So, for those fortunate enough to have disposable funds, the only option is to put those funds into risky speculative investments, where the fundamentals have been thrown out the window long ago instead of a productive growing economy.

* And those who control the system have no interest in changing things, because they reap so many benefits. And so, we remain stuck with an inefficient, unfair and unproductive system.
