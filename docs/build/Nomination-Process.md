## What is Nomination ?
Nomination is the process of staking AXIA Coins to a Validator to support a network while receiving a reward in return. A Nominator can select a particular Validator from the Validator list and nominate them by staking their AXIA Coins. When they do so, they are vouching for that specific validator, and the nomination is a signal of trust in the AXIA Network. When nominating, tokens are deducted instantly and added to the total amount staked by the Nominator.


:::note A nominator should know:

* What is a Node ID? 

-> A Node ID is an identifier for a node in an remote server's address space. Nominators can identify Validators through Node IDs.

* What is Validator Stake?

-> The maximum weight of a Validator (their own stake + stake nominated to them) 5 times stake of validator (min is 100,000), max can be based on stake of a validator * 5.

* What is "No. of Nominator"?
 
-> Number of AXIA Coin users that are staking their AXIA Coin to a particular Validator.

* What is End Time? 

-> End Time is the remaining validation period for a Validator.

* What is the Fee? 

-> The fee for a Nominator is how much you have to pay to the network from your gained reward.

:::caution

Nominators will receive rewards in their wallet address at the end of the nomination period as long as all of these parameters are met:

* The minimum amount of time one can stake funds for nomination is 120 Days
* The maximum amount of time one can stake funds for nomination is 2 years
* The minimum nomination fee rate is 2%


:::note

A Validator will receive a staking reward if they are online and responsive for more than 80% of their validation period, as measured by a majority of Validators, weighted by stake. You should aim for your Validator to be online and responsive 100% of the time.
