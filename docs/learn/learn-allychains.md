The AXIA AllyChains are next-generation layer-1 blockchains that combine the power of multiple independently running chains to its CoreChain, forming the backbone of the AXIA network and building a network of sovereign chains. CoreChain is the layer-0 protocol that underlies and supports this network of layer-1 AllyChains. The cross-chain interoperability of the AXIA Network allows any type of data or asset exchange between AllyChains; it will enable a new design of interoperable chains while developing future decentralized communities and economies. The AXIA Network brings scalability to blockchain technology in a more decentralized and trustless way rather than relying purely on layer-2 scaling solutions.Transactions are spread across the network, taking place 'in-parallel' or simultaneously on several blockchains secured by a single set of decentralized validators. The validator ecosystem is also well spread out and decentralized by the virtue of multiple AllyChains as the AXIA network ecosystem will grow with each AllyChain contributing validator nodes.
