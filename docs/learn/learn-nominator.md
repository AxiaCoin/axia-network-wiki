There are a variety of services and products available for which participants can take advantage right away. These services and products offer greater convenience, efficiency, autonomy along with favorable benefits and rewards; while providing even greater real-world utility for AXIA Coin in the ever expanding ecosystem.
### THE AXIA WALLET  
The AXIA Wallet will be embedded in all applications in the AXIA Ecosystem.

The wallet is a free and secure tool that offers the ability to transact, exchange, buy, sell, hold, store, send and receive AXIA Coins. The wallet is also the means through which users of AXIA Coin receive unparalleled benefits and rewards just for participating.  

Once a person registers for their AXIA Wallet, those credentials can be conveniently used for every application in the AXIA Ecosystem. Once the profile is created, the wallet is generated. From there, participants will have access to each application. This profile can be synced across all their hardware devices such as a phone, computer or tablet.
 
AXIA is providing greater efficiency and more upside potential along with favorable rewards and benefits for all people who come into the ecosystem who have generated an AXIA Wallet. 

The AXIA Wallet can also be used to empower people to develop income for themselves. An AXIA Ecosystem participant can easily utilize the AXIA Wallet as a tool to generate additional earnings and rewards from their own followers, subscribers, users, attendees, services and products they offer depending on the application within the AXIA Ecosystem. They can leverage any of the apps to their advantage to pursue their own entrepreneurial goals just by maximizing the additional utility offered by having the AXIA Wallet embedded in all the applications.

All activity taking place in the AXIA Wallet within the AXIA Ecosystem can be settled instantaneously, and completed in a more cost-efficient manner than if conducted outside the AXIA Network. Moreover, there is the simultaneous added advantage that this activity will direct value back to strengthening AXIA Coin itself through the mechanism of coin burning leading to the reduction in Total Supply.
### AXIA SECURE KEY STORAGE AND TOKEN CUSTODY SERVICE
The self-management and recovery of a user’s public and private wallet keys is a clear challenge slowing the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies. Some of the main concerns of using cryptocurrencies relate to  the ease of use of wallet applications, and overall security of funds. If a user’s keys are lost, forgotten, or in some cases, stolen, their cryptocurrencies and funds are gone forever.

This is why the AXIA Key Storage and Token Custody Service, connected into the “hot” and “cold” wallet application, is invaluable. AXIA has implemented its very own key storage model that incorporates state-of-the-art data encryption to protect a user at all times from potential system attacks that could jeopardize their keys, and stops them from falling into the wrong hands. Additionally, AXIA has implemented an account creation mechanism where a user’s public and private keys are tied to a self-selected email address and their system password can always be re-generated if needed ensuring they will never lose access to their funds. Now, AXIA Coin holders can recover their existing key(s) if lost or forgotten.

Registering within the AXIA public blockchain ecosystem offers a user the ability to securely store their AXIA Coins in both hot and cold storage wallets. A hot wallet account will allow users to immediately send, transfer, exchange and spend their digital AXIA Coins directly out of their wallet, while a “cold” wallet will enable users to securely store their AXIA Coins in an offline storage vault, locking AXIA Coins away until such time as a user wishes to move it into hot status. 

The AXIA custody solution meets and exceeds enterprise-scale custody services that are typically only offered to digital exchanges, investment funds or other institutional-sized clients who pass along the costs for third party management to the individual users. AXIA has specifically integrated its own custody service to allow all AXIA participants – irrespective of wealth or status – to utilize this advanced infrastructure seamlessly for free. The AXIA Foundation will incur any associated custody costs on behalf of the user directly, while the user is in control of their own spendable or vaulted AXIA Coins. 

By utilizing cold storage, a user is designating their own AXIA Coins to be stored and managed offline in a vault. This vault structure is unhackable. All transfers require coordinated actions with multiple factors of authentication to protect users, even if someone were to steal their phone or compromise their desktop application. 

Participants can take advantage of the storage model at the AXIA Capital Bank. 
### AXIA CAPITAL BANK

### AXIA LOYALTY PROGRAM
Traditional Loyalty Programs function based on a one-to-one relationship between a customer and a business. The value of the “points” never goes up, they are completely static. There are expenses associated with running the program and also the potential of liability on a balance sheet.

The AXIA Loyalty Program offers unprecedented incentives that boost customer engagement,
spend and business revenue in an innovative and unique manner. It is dynamic, not static. AXIA
accomplishes this in an entirely new way. Instead of the one-to-one relationship between the customer and business, both benefit from the power of the crowd. The customer benefits not just from all the other shoppers at that store, but all activity across the AXIA Ecosystem – activity that is completely
unrelated to themselves and the store. This can generate greater purchasing power for the customer.

The business gains from the crowd even more with the AXIA Loyalty Program, because without investing time or additional expense, the business can now gain revenue, improve margins and increase profitability from activity that they have nothing to do with. AXIA can also assist with more efficient and cost effective transaction processing.

AXIA Loyalty partners are also listed online as a preferred partner and/or adopter of AXIA. This can create greater awareness and exposure for the businesses globally.
