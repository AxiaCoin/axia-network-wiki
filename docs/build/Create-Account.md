If you don't have an AXIA Web Wallet you can create a new one here: [AXIA Web Wallet](https://wallet-v2.testnet.axiacoin.network/). Select the 'CREATE NEW WALLET' option.

You will be redirected to a new page to generate a key phrase. Click on the 'Generate Key Phrase' option.
![pjs-01](../assets/webWallet/w5.png)

After that you will be shown a random 24-word Mnemonic key phrase. Write down or store the mnemonic key phrase in a safe place as it will be required to restore your account in the future. Then, click on "ACCESS WALLET."

In the next phase you need to verify that Mnemonic key phrase. This process is for the security and safety of your wallet. To proceed, select three words from the mnemonic you have already stored according to that number and then verify it.

If you select the right words...congratulations, your wallet is created and you a part of our AXIA Ecosystem!

Your wallet will look like this:

Your wallet is automatically connected to all three blockchains on the AXIA Network. You can see all three of the addresses connected to your wallet in the top right corner. 

This is your **SwapChain** address. The SwapChain is a decentralized platform for creating and trading the AXIA Network's native token, AXIA Coin.

This is your **CoreChain** address. The CoreChain coordinates network Validators and can be used for staking through the AXIA Web Wallet.

Lastly you can see your **AXChain** address. The AXChain allows users to create smart contracts and interact with DApps and DeFi services.
