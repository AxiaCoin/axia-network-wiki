Since the creation of the modern central bank, there has been an implicit agreement that governments will regulate the financial system in the best interest of their citizens. But time and time again, this implicit social bargain has broken down, as national governments are either unable or unwilling to design a system that works to the benefit of all. 

The modern financial system has evolved to become a house of cards built on an unstable foundation, underwritten by the massive expansion and constant accumulation of debt in the endless pursuit of short-term economic growth. All of this has been at the expense of long-term global economic unity, stability and prosperity. 

Even the manner in which economic growth is measured and calculated is flawed. Gross domestic product (GDP), a metric that can be utilized to gage the welfare of the state and its people, simply does not capture an accurate picture of the well-being and livelihood of its citizens. This single macroeconomic indicator does not offer sufficient insight into the health of the economy, nor how income is so unevenly distributed. 

Additionally, those in government can too easily fall prey to human instinct of self-interest. In this case, unlike the individual citizen, they have the system on their side, leading to an unfair power structure primed for manipulation and corruption. Furthermore, financial systems are intentionally designed to benefit the elite few and oppress the many. The systems in place have created individualistic cultures at the expense of collective values. People are either born into privilege or oppression, and thanks in part to the unequal distribution of government benefits, disenfranchised individuals everywhere around the world are left with little opportunity to change their own fates. 

This, combined with a lack of connection to the important service that banking provides the global public is partly why there have been few, if any, real consequences for the corrupt governments, dictatorships or individuals who have stolen generational wealth and destroyed the livelihoods of millions in order to serve themselves. As things stand, we can leave the governance of the global economic order to the rule of law, but if the foundation of the order is not laid out with a common set of applied and practical rules with clear consequences, there will be no effective change to the system. 

So instead we, the citizens of the world, are left on the sidelines to watch as governments and their central banks respond to often self-inflicted monetary and financial crises by literally papering over mistakes of the past, through the injection of what appears to be an infinite amount of constantly-depreciating fiat currency into the global market. In this way, nations around the world have pushed global debt to historic levels, devaluing their currencies, and in doing so, furthering the theft of wealth from citizens. Such a process essentially kicks the can down the street, and ensures that when a crisis does hit, the global economy isnâ€™t spared from the destabilizing economic and social consequences that follow when contagion invariably spreads. The elite go unpunished and normal people pay the price, this has not fundamentally changed since the times when kings, queens and emperors reigned supreme. 

The unbanked and underbanked are often associated with people living in regions where the access to, or use of, financial services is difficult. But this phenomenon is not limited to those living in areas rife with government corruption or economic instability, where financial institutions cannot be trusted with deposits. In 2019, the U.S. Federal Reserve reported that more than 1 in 5 Americans, or 63 million people, are underbanked or unbanked. Whether it is not having access to a bank, low levels of financial literacy, or relying heavily on payday loans and alternative financial services, the inequitable access to banking has created a situation where people lack the liquidity to make purchases or payments easily and are vulnerable to predatory interest rates on loans.

The monopoly of government-issued money has not only deprived us of good money, but has also deprived us of the only process by which we can find out what would be good money and what that good money could do to better the world.
