AXtend is a bridge that supports Ethereum compatibility with the AXIA Network AllyChain environment. This enables projects and developers to continue to use the programming languages and tools they have become accustomed to but within a fast-growing, scalable Layer 1 chain with far superior economics and technology. AXtend is another element that fulfills the goal of establishing true interoperability across multiple chains. This provides a valuable addition to the AXIA Network and Ecosystem due to the fact there are cross-chain smart contract capabilities. AXtend not only provides a new level of convenience for users and assets to exist across multiple blockchains but establishes more favorable options for existing projects.

AXtend is also compatible with the entire AXIA Ecosystem, making for greater flexibility and simplicity regardless of the chosen tools.Furthermore, developers are able to deploy smart contracts on the AXIA Network as an AllyChain that are compatible with Ethereum. Since AXtend offers an interoperability layer with existing Ethereum based tools, it will support all applications that were originally written for the EVM environment without friction on the AXIA Network
