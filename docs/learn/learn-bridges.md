AXIA CoreChain allows any project to either consume the network as it is by utilizing the given token and token economies of the default AllyChain. However, they will also be having the flexibility to spin up their own AllyChain in case a separate token and economics is required for the project. The created AllyChain will continue to inherit all the characteristics of AXIA AllyChain and operate cohesively with CoreChain.
