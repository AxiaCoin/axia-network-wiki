It is a more inclusive, decentralized blockchain that is scalable, fast and interoperable, with innovative economics to benefit people all around the world. The native currency of the network is AXIA Coin. AXIA Coin is the first ever hyper-deflationary digital currency that can be used globally. AXIA Coin has a limited supply that reduces based on participation, activity and staking in its expanding ecosystem as well as the utility to be used as a preferred medium of exchange. 

AXIA employs an aggressive coin burning model to ensure greater scarcity of AXIA Coin over time and, along with the strength and support of the AXIA Treasury, offers the market a one-of-a-kind opportunity where any participant in the network and all users of AXIA Coin will be delivered ongoing benefits through decentralized activity by people around the world.

AXIA is designed to upend traditional financial structures through users connecting to the network and the adoption and usage of AXIA Coin via highly advanced and innovative blockchain and smart contract technology. The mission at the heart of AXIA is to advance a more decentralized, equitable, inclusionary, fair and robust economic model for people around the world.

This goal is set in motion through the disruptive design of AXIA, which brings a better economic system that is far more inclusive and energy efficient, removing barriers to entry and allowing people from around the world to gain from the advantages of this next generation blockchain. This can set a new standard for the industry through which AXIA will achieve its purpose by offering:
