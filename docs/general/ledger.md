Central banks have distorted the ability to send clear signals out to markets with their practice of constantly increasing the supply of money. True price discovery does not exist. Any hope for a free self-regulating economy faded long ago.

With a small group of people, with limited diversity in their backgrounds and points of view controlling the money supply, this lends itself to irresponsible actions born out of short-sightedness and self-interest. 

Central Banks have allowed financial institutions to lend with impunity and without regard for the long-term risk. This has created moral hazard across financial markets, with markets and financial institutions knowing a bail out will always be waiting if necessary. 

Time is running out. With rising levels of wealth concentration, anti-intellectualism, polarization, unfairness and oppression, and civil unrest will only get worse. Societal breakdown is often the result of foundational and distributional problems in an economy.  

With society stuck in total immobility, the current monetary and financial system will eventually come to an end. Since the leaders refuse to change it, a fairer solution will eventually emerge from the people sooner or later. Throughout history, a common denominator lies behind mass protests, riots, and wars -  the economy and unequal sharing of prosperity. Perhaps the well known phrase “It’s the economy, stupid” should instead read “ It’s the stupid economy”.
