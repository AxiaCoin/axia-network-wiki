Should central banks issue their own digital currency, it would be a complete game changer in how markets can be manipulated.

The Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) money would sit in a digital wallet. At that point whatever happens would be outside of anyoneâ€™s control. Individuals would only have the ability to spend or save. However, the goal of central banks is to get individuals to spend and disincentivize savings. 

If CBDCs came into existence, inflation could be instituted in real-time. As there is concern over loss of purchasing power at any moment, people would become increasingly likely to spend.

Beyond the fact that all transactions will be more easily tracked, central banks could impose restrictions on what can be purchased, initiate expiry dates on funds, set up limits on savings. Basically your money is no longer your money.

As our freedom is becoming more and more under threat, the potential issuance of CBDCs just provide a greater indication as to why a true alternative is so desperately needed as soon as possible.
