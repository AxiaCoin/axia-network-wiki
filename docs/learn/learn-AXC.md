# AXIA COIN - THE NEW RESERVE CURRENCY FOR THE WORLD
The future is here. AXIA Coin is the evolution of money.

AXIA Coin sets a new standard for what a currency is, what a currency can be, and what a currency can do for us. It is the democratization of money, where financial power never trumps democratic power. AXIA Coin will function in a true free market where consumers can and will demand both the preservation and creation of value, efficiency and quality in all respects while still offering the ability for exchange. 

The primary purpose of AXIA is value creation. AXIA is giving us better money, allowing the market system to function infinitely better than it has ever done before. By removing the systemic risk associated with fiat currencies or stablecoins, as well as applying the hyper-deflationary token economic model combined with the innovative and transparent asset-supporting structure to mitigate the price volatility of alternatives, AXIA Coin not only offers a true store of value, but establishes a superior store of value. 

Moreover, AXIA Coin provides an extraordinary value proposition for users. One that is unmatched in the global marketplace, making it a preferred medium of exchange. The purpose of AXIA is to deliver real fundamental value to everyone in the community in a completely trustworthy and transparent manner. AXIA strives to make a positive social impact around the globe. This is the ethos of AXIA. 

The participants in the AXIA Ecosystem will retain value for themselves and produce value for others thanks to the various forms of utility that will continue to expand over time. AXIA is designed to function within a participatory model whereby users can insert their own value into the system through decentralized activity. AXIA Coin can modernize commerce and change the economic paradigm by transforming the benefits we receive through barter and trade. The simple act of participating or being active within the AXIA Ecosystem can impact oneself and others instantaneously, continuously providing an immediate positive feedback. Never before has money had the ability to be so impactful for us all. The economic activity we initiate creates value in a perpetual way where the benefits continue to build over time and deliver value back. Through its hyper-deflationary economic model, the constant burning of AXIA Coins from the total maximum available supply as a function of network activity and participation, value is created through ever growing scarcity. This value creation is even more amplified and protected through the underlying assets in the AXIA Treasury strengthening the ecosystem and hence providing the means for network activity to constantly grow. 

The more value created translates to a greater amount of value for all.

We need not move away from allowing individuals the freedom to pursue their own self-interests, however AXIA dramatically alters the consequences by changing the system itself. The motivation for self-interest can remain, but the hoarding of wealth and power will stagnate and eliminate the growth we desire for ourselves. By participating, cooperating and by circulating wealth and power, we create more value for others and ourselves. It is in our own self-interest to distribute AXIA Coin to as many people as possible across the globe as it will only enrich our own lives. Rather than pitting one against the other in intense forms of individualism and competition, AXIA can connect people together by creating new forms of financial and social bonds in a way never seen before. 

## AXIA AND AXIA COIN - WITHOUT EQUAL
One of the most revolutionary features of AXIA is the linkage of the hyper-deflationary AXIA Coin and a decentralized public blockchain to the accumulation of publicly real-time reported assets. This, combined with the benefits that arise from a growing participatory ecosystem and the production of economic value being delivered back to members of the AXIA community through its global utilization. Growth through creation of value through all forms of economic contribution.

Users will have the opportunity to amplify the value of their currency simply by participating and conducting commerce as they otherwise would. The transparency of assets held in the AXIA Treasury, combined with the utility offered within the AXIA Ecosystem and its transparent reduction of the AXIA Coin Total Supply, creates the conditions for the establishment of AXIA Coin as a real and transparent store of value that can be measured against all forms of currency. This is accomplished via a technology mix that was impossible to contemplate back when individuals were trading shells for beads. 

The creation of a real store of value can only be achieved by embracing blockchain technology that lays bare the underlying fundamentals of AXIA Coin. The conditions for broad public trust and acceptance should be met by bringing transparency to digital currency through publicly reporting a full and complete list of all transactions taking place on the blockchain the world. 

As global debt continues to rise to historic levels for individuals, corporations and sovereign nations, a non-debt-based currency with a maximum supply that is constantly decreasing can provide a calming influence in a turbulent and uncertain market. The fact that AXIA Coin is an asset-supported currency, which can continually build value through its global adoption and utilization, provides the catalyst that will flip the traditional currency paradigm on its head. 

Although AXIA Coin has been designed to function as a true medium of exchange, it goes well beyond the transparency of most central bank issued currencies. AXIA Coin holders will always benefit from unsurpassed clarity on both asset holdings through the AXIA Real-Time Reporting Platform attached to the AXIA Treasury, public AXIA Coin transactions and Total Supply reduction of the coin. As any form of activity and/or participation associated with AXIA Coin increases, so too can the accumulation of value in the AXIA Treasury, all while the continued burning of AXIA Coin from the Total Supply will provide participants with the ultimate value creation and protection. This makes AXIA Coin a safe haven. 

Consequently, while the AXIA Transaction Link (ATL) rewards the user community with the value associated with their activity and participation through the mechanism in which AXIA Coins are consistently burned across the AXIA Network, so too will the community stand to benefit from the long-term accumulation of value through an innovative decentralized model. This structure affords the AXIA community with unprecedented near and long-term benefits when compared to the value derived from sovereign currencies. 

Unlike AXIA Coins, the purchasing power of fiat currencies erodes over time, to the disadvantage of its holders. Only a specified and finite amount of AXIA Coins will be released which continuously decreases over time as a function of utilization, and will be elements that act as a safeguard along with the support of the underlying asset-base and the ever expanding ecosystem. They protect not only preservation of AXIA Coin value, but also counteract any market manipulation, spikes in inflation, devaluation, recession, financial instability, political corruption and turmoil that can negatively influence or damage the value of other forms of currency. 
## AXIA COIN - MEDIUM OF EXCHANGE
AXIA will stand alone as the preferred medium of exchange and become the new reserve currency for the world.

Unlike approaches taken by other digital currencies, AXIA breaks the mold of the fundamental functions of money – store of value, unit of account and medium of exchange – by adding a fourth vital function: creation of value. 

AXIA utilizes an efficient and modern design that re-imagines the world without the U.S. dollar as the global reserve currency. AXIA operates in complete contrast to the alternatives in the conventional and non-conventional markets. There is no stripping away value from participants, as the reason for its existence is to deliver value back to users and the community as a whole. AXIA Coin is a hyper-deflationary, distributed digital currency designed to power a ready-built and expandable ecosystem. 

AXIA Coin works in concert with other native and minable network tokens to allow for transactions to be validated and recorded in full view of the public. These functions are built into a distributed public blockchain network that reliably verifies the existence and movement of AXIA Coin between participants. 

When compared to other digital currency projects, the unique design of AXIA stands apart from the rest.

AXIA utilizes smart contract enabled network logic to move the industry forward, towards decentralization and monetary transparency. Doing so will seed the development of various new economic models built into its digital asset ecosystem to address the monetary and economic shortcomings of Bitcoin and other digital token projects. 

The AXIA model establishes a digital currency with AXIA Coin that, above all else, is designed to act as the ideal global medium of value exchange while simultaneously establishing the conditions for an entirely new form of money to spread the world over. 
## AXIA COIN - STORE OF VALUE  
AXIA is establishing a preferred, stronger and safer store of value with AXIA Coin.

Instruments like gold or Bitcoin are considered stores of value because they are viewed as hedges against inflation or currency risk. 

Leaving aside the question of whether these instruments should be considered stores of value, they are still exposed to market conditions. The value is determined by whatever the market price is at any given time. No matter what asset is being held it will stand alone and be priced based on market conditions.

In AXIA, nothing stands alone. The AXIA Network and the boundless ecosystem acts as a connective tissue bringing all things together not only sheltering from risk, but amplifying value.

Whereas certain “assets” may have some appeal as a singular hedge, AXIA Coin goes well beyond a singular hedge to provide an extra layer of protection.

Unlike Bitcoin, which is considered a deflationary instrument with a singular hedge against loss in purchasing power, AXIA Coin, on the other hand, is a double downside hedge monetary instrument. The hyper-deflationary design of AXIA Coin incentivizes all participants by constantly increasing supply scarcity, while the asset-support provides additional protection.

All the decentralized activity, whether it be through participation, staking, transaction volume, exchange, or any form of business operations all comes back to accumulate more and more value. This bolsters the network along with fortifying and augmenting the AXIA Treasury with the simultaneous reduction in supply adding more strength and support for AXIA Coin itself.

This manner in which the system functions does not just protect purchasing power, it can amplify it through the creation of value by AXIA community members. AXIA Coin can protect and amplify value unlike its predecessors  such as fiat currency, gold or Bitcoin because it functions within a collective structure along with its unique token economic model. 

Moreover, AXIA is not just protection against market risk, it is a protection against a debt-based global economy. 

AXIA is about increasing efficiency and economic growth across the board, not through debt, but through actual productivity for the benefit of all, where that productivity will continue to build for everyone.

We are all interconnected in this global economy, but currently only the few and the fortunate are able to extract the spoils. AXIA is designed to spoil us all.
## AXIA COIN - CREATOR OF VALUE
In the current economic paradigm, there is a synergy between spending and income. One person's spending is another person's income. When a person goes to a store and spends money, they create income for that store owner. That store owner then spends money elsewhere creating income for another, and so on. The money/currency circulates throughout the economy from these transactions. 

Spending for consumption is the reason why most transactions occur. This results in less money available for individuals to spend. So, on top of the currency utilized for these transactions losing value, when there is spending for consumption, if more money is not accumulated by the person who is spending that person can fall even further behind.
 
Economic growth is extremely dependent on spending. Since average incomes are not increasing at the same rate that money is losing value, the only way to have these transactions and exchanges take place in abundance is for us to exist in a debt-based economy. But this debt just artificially keeps the system afloat - for now.
 
AXIA changes the economic paradigm. With AXIA Coin, not only when someone directly participaties with AXIA, but when an individual executes the exact same transfer or transaction as that they would with another medium of exchange, they become a creator of value for themselves and everyone else in the AXIA Community. Nothing about the transfer or transaction has to change. It is simply about using a superior instrument that delivers value in an unrivaled manner compared to traditional mediums of exchange, which generate no value for its holders.

In the current economic structure, and despite the constant volume of transactions in the economy, as currency circulates there are no lasting effects or benefits to the parties that engage in each exchange.  When AXIA Coin is removed from circulation as well as moves through transactions and transfers from one participant to another, it now spawns a constant creation of value felt throughout the entire AXIA Network. All this decentralized activity that is completely unrelated to any one individual has the power to create value in an extraordinary way - just from the things we do everyday.
  
Every participant is providing and receiving value simultaneously as participation and activity in the ecosystem take place. This occurs whether a participant takes part in the activity taking place or not. The participatory model of AXIA completely enables the removal of barriers for people all over the world. An AXIA participant receives all the value that AXIA delivers while immediately having the power to create even more value for themselves and others. 

When people, anywhere, participate as part of the AXIA community they can potentially provide benefits for millions and millions of people around the world instantly eliciting a positive feedback loop.The generation of value by engaging in activity in the AXIA community is tracked over the blockchain and AXIA Network in a completely transparent way. All participation will be visible in an immediate fashion.

This positive feedback loop is not accomplished by changing behavior, but by giving the value back to the people. Giving value back to its community is what AXIA is delivering while people are transacting with each other. This mechanism delivers a positive impact on our world in a way that was impossible to realize before today. 

This positive impact is the ethos behind the economic design of AXIA. AXIA introduces an inclusionary model that allows everyone in the world to participate. AXIA is not just an opportunity for the wealthy, it is an opportunity for everyone. The more people participate, the more value is created and the more benefit that is delivered for the entire community. The simple act of sending and receiving AXIA Coin can prompt a ripple effect, causing the value generated today to trigger benefits and rewards that can be experienced for years to come. 

AXIA can create new streams of economic growth and new ways to increase productivity, without the accumulation of debt. The AXIA Ecosystem is more efficient and fair compared to alternatives and provides never before seen opportunities and ways of generating prosperity. 

AXIA is built to stand alone as the standard bearer of not just a preferred currency, but as a means to connect all people around the world. It is designed to not only create economic bonds, but social bonds empowering everyone who participates to improve their own life and the lives of others around the globe.
## AXIA COIN BURNING MODEL
One of the essential components of the AXIA hyper-deflationary design is the AXIA coin burner. With it AXIA is implementing its supercharged coin burning model. In the AXIA economic design, increase in participation, staking and network usage creates more and more scarcity of the AXIA Coin. 

It is doing that by rewarding new participation in the project such that for every coin that is acquired by a user - one equal coin is removed permanently from the Total Supply, implemented transparently through the AXIA token burn contract. Furthemore, this is enhanced by a similar structure for staking. When AXIA Coins are placed into a staking pool an equivalent amount of coins will also be permanently eliminated from Total Supply. Therefore participants have the opportunity to burn twice as many AXIA Coins beyond their level of participation with this only increasing over time through network usage or re-staking.

In addition AXIA is flipping the idea of what fees are on its head. In AXIA, fees are not punitive. In fact, it is the exact opposite. All fees generated through network activity in the AXIA Ecosystem also contribute to  creating greater scarcity of the AXIA Coin. 

It is with these elements that contribute to burning, that is why the total amount of AXIA Coin is not simply a static finite supply goes beyond being just finite. As the Total Supply will be constantly diminished through participation, staking, utilization and activity. With a supply that is consistently decreasing this constantly improves supply and demand economics. The more rare something becomes the more valuable it can become. Constantly increasing scarcity of AXIA Coin is activated with continuous decentralized activity within the AXIA ecosystem. This means that participation, staking and fees actually benefit all AXIA community members on an ongoing basis. The more participation grows, the more staking increases and the more fees are collected, the more the community benefits. 

All the coins that are to be permanently removed from Total Supply through participation, staking and collection from any application, platform or activity within the AXIA Ecosystem will be “burned” by sending the AXIA Coins to an AXIA Coin Burner smart contract. The smart contract makes certain that any AXIA Coins that are burned will be permanently irretrievable. At the contract construction stage, it calls a method from the AXIA Coin Token smart contract to ensure the smart contract administrator cannot move AXIA Coin under any and all circumstances. The smart contract has no method to support coin withdrawals. Hence, any coin in that smart contract is considered permanently removed from existence or “burned”.
## AXIA DEMOCRATIZING DATA
AXIA does not offer any of its own data for sale. Rather it offers a simple, secure and decentralized way for others to offer their data and in doing so, provide value to the AXIA Network and themselves.

Through incentives provided by AXIA and blockchain technology, this gives birth to a technological catalyst which will open up numerous markets. The revolutionary decentralized feature that AXIA offers is that data will no longer accrue to the aggregator for their own benefit but rather to the individuals and business that are providing, sharing, storing, buying and exchanging the data.

Rather than collecting data sets strictly for corporate interest, AXIA allows anyone to not only share and exchange this data, but to build different models using that data, allowing them to amplify the value of the data in an extraordinary way.

Contributors can earn unparalleled rewards as companies use AXIA Coin to purchase the datasets and insights, which would in turn add more underlying value to AXIA. The result would be more contributors and higher quality datasets as the market sets the going rate for information and compensates participants accordingly relative to their contribution.

A wide variety of datasets can be tokenized in the AXIA Network. This includes something as simple as time, a commodity like gold, or a business. It is all converted into data, which then can be “monetized” within this unique economic system offered by the Network that is constantly amplifying value. As the tokenization process is done these data points can be exchanged for something of real value - AXIA Coin.

The immutability of public blockchains allows network participants to be confident in the fact that the data written to them hasn’t been tampered with or changed in any way and that it will be available and accessible far into the future.

Once the data has been tokenized, the data sets can be fractionalized among more than just the two parties engaging in an exchange. This allows a vast amount of exchange for several different reasons that are within the control and at the discretion of the holder of the data set. An individual can convert their own time and attention into phone minutes, groceries and so on. Businesses can be tokenized to receive liquidity in a preferred instrument for payroll requirements, upgrades etc. 
### The main objectives of data tokenization, sharing and exchange in the AXIA Ecosystem are to:
* Create a more fair and equitable system where all parties gain value from any form of contribution or exchange 
* Have the data be more secure with ownership going to the contributor of the data
* Create greater efficiency, a higher level of trust and the removal of intermediaries
* Fractionalize the data sets to allow for exchange across multiple platforms, applications and purposes
AXIA Coin is what is used to purchase data on the network. Users need to exchange  coins in order to purchase data. Because of the fixed amount of AXIA Coins available, the more purchases and exchanges that take place, the more the value creation can accelerate and the more the supply of AXIA Coins goes down. This mechanism supports the positive feedback loop of the AXIA Ecosystem. This will allow for a global decentralized marketplace of exchange traded data to run on simple supply and demand economics.

Nothing will stand alone in the data exchange across the AXIA Network. The value that a participant brings through the tokenization process immediately attaches to the entire ecosystem, amplifying the value creation. The continual expansion of the AXIA Ecosystem over time means more and more purchases and exchanges will naturally take place.

## AXIA DATA MONETIZATION / TOKENIZATION
Technology has now given us the ability to transfer tremendous amounts of data in an instant. The data collected and transferred from the time and attention of individuals is one of these sources of data. The new refrain that “data is the new oil” evokes the ideals of power, hoarding, centralization and control that are allowing a few internet titans, and their networks, to profit from the information of the masses. Selected individuals make billions of dollars from your data. They do not want to lose their source of income. 

The AXIA Project not only offers democratic rights for money - AXIA Coin - but also allows participants to take control of their data and can deliver value in a variety of different ways.  

So, with AXIA, the concentration of gains from data will be no more. AXIA aims to return the ownership of data back to its users, and allow them to keep the financial gain connected to their personal data. Whether through viewing ads or the use of applications, participants in the AXIA Ecosystem will have access to the monetary benefits of their data. Rather than using these applications that we use every single day knowing all our activity is being tracked for corporate interest in an industry that generates hundreds of billions of dollars a year, AXIA instead delivers that value right back to the participants.

AXIA participants can take full ownership of the data generated in the ecosystem and utilize it however they want. What people put their time and attention towards can be tokenized in the AXIA Ecosystem and therefore monetized for their gain just like any other asset.This “asset” - a person’s time and attention - is currently being taken by stealth secretly for the benefit of corporate interest. With AXIA, participants are in complete control of this asset, an asset that many didn't even know they had. 

In addition, AXIA offers a decentralized platform connecting the buyers of data directly with the willing sellers. This removes the intermediaries and brings more efficiency to the industry. Rather than using these intermediaries which can only offer low percentage engagement of desired groups, buyers of data can now ensure a 100% success rate due to the fact the seller must meet specific qualifications prior to any exchange taking place. Sellers will have the ability to choose in advance what information they wish to disclose, knowing that any personal information remains private and encrypted. Sellers will also be able to examine in advance the value of engaging in any task causing more efficiency between how buyers and sellers interact. 

All this data produces additional utility by being converted into AXIA Coins while also amplifying its value. This use case fits perfectly with the economic philosophy and model of AXIA.

With participants now receiving these rewards, benefits and earnings it essentially opens up the potential to generate value for themselves in a completely decentralized way. This also generates value for AXIA Coin and everyone who is part of the community.
 
Even with the most utilized applications - Google, Facebook, Instagram, Netflix - there is the opportunity now to earn additional benefits and rewards through a decentralized platform for exchange between data buyers and sellers. These interactions are poised to create a scenario where the exchange between buyer and seller adds even more value to AXIA Coin. The Total Supply of AXIA Coins will also continue to diminish with each acquisition and exchange due to the ongoing reduction in Total Supply.
 
So, this opportunity goes far beyond just the AXIA applications being offered as part of the AXIA Ecosystem to maximize the value for members of the AXIA community. 
## AXIA TRANSACTION LINK (ATL) 
The AXIA Transaction Link (ATL) is one of the defining features of the AXIA Project. It directs AXIA Coins to be permanently removed from Total Supply whenever an AXIA Coin transferred for participation, staking or transactions either inside or outside of the AXIA Ecosystem (excluding peer-to-peer transactions which have no fees), the ATL has the power to direct the specified amount of AXIA Coins to be removed permanently from the Total Supply in perpetuity – effectively burning the AXIA Coins. This onchain transaction process model will recognize AXIA Wallet addresses and activate a removal function.

AXIA will then utilize the coins accumulated through the velocity of the movement of AXIA Coins to generate increased scarcity of supply, which provides even greater structural integrity to AXIA Coin and value back to the AXIA community. This can provide a direct financial benefit for all parties holding and utilizing AXIA Coin. 

Rather than value that is traditionally siphoned away as corporate or shareholder profit, the ATL can specify that value to enable its deflationary reduction of Total Supply. This feature can reward community members for their shared participation in the ecosystem. The system is designed to be efficient, transparent and secure, while also reducing volatility and the business risk associated with holding a digital asset.
