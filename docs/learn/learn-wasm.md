Understanding that time is a limited and precious resource, time banking allows any organization to effectively reward individuals for their contributions to social or organizational good. When AXIA Coin is used as remuneration for volunteer work for a charitable organization, it would be usable as currency or could be donated back to charities. AXIA Coin can be used as a reward for volunteer work to incentivize people to give back through donating their time and receive a financial benefit for doing so. AXIA Time Banking functions as a peer-to-peer platform connecting philanthropists, charities and willing volunteers around the world. AXIA Time Banking can assist with increasing adoption and transaction volume by bringing some that may not otherwise be not be in the position to join the community to do so by providing their own time and creating a positive social impact. Similar to the child birth benefit feature, donations for this feature will be accepted, with the potential for corporate sponsorships and partnerships.
