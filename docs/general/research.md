We now live in a world where the majority of the global population scarcely remembers a time before the existence of the Internet. Similarly, there may soon come a time when people scarcely remember the interconnected digital economic world before blockchain, and the digital currency projects that blockchain and decentralized applications have enabled. A blockchain is a distributed ledger that publicly records all transactions

The rise of blockchain technology has revolutionized how we think about money. Money can be transferred peer-to-peer through a decentralized network without passing through a central authority. 

There are a few radical differences between cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies. For example, cryptocurrency transactions are recorded in an unfalsifiable ledger that relies not on the authority of banks or governments, but on the strength of a public computer network. Blockchain technology can be programmed to give us incorruptible information. 

Blockchain enables us to create foolproof, guaranteed records of transactions, entirely without reliance on outside authorities such as banks or governments. Now that the transparent and decentralized power of blockchain technology has been unleashed, there is simply no going back.

Blockchain technology possesses the ability to radically change lives for the betterment of humanity. On a distributed blockchain, no single entity controls the network. Anyone with access to the internet can participate and people from all around the world hold identical copies of transaction ledgers on their computers. These computers are called nodes. Every time a transaction occurs, the node must independently update and verify it from a piece of data called a “block,” which is arranged in a chain that together consists of all the historical records of transactions that have occurred. Each block contains a collection of unconfirmed transactions, transaction time-stamps, and references for the latest transactions in the confirmed ledger. Coupling these blockchain network systems with transparent forms of blockchain-based money or cryptocurrency can deliver a currency that is not susceptible to unplanned inflation or interference by intermediaries. Independent currencies that can operate both inside and outside of the existing monetary system offer users a choice in the ways they can store and transfer value, and an alternative to the zero-sum conceit of debt-based money that must incur costs elsewhere. 

There are three dimensions of currency: 

1. Representation: Money can be represented in virtual form or physical form 
2. Transaction Handling: Money can be transacted in centralized or decentralized payment systems 
3. Money Creation: Some monies are created by a monopoly, while others are issued under competition

Cryptocurrency has the potential to disrupt the current payment infrastructure and the financial system. In general, it could affect all businesses and government agencies that are involved in recordkeeping. The special feature of cryptocurrencies is that they combine the transactional advantages of virtual money with the systemic independence of decentralized transaction processing.
