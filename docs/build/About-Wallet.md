## Introduction
AXIA is a platform for decentralized applications that aims to enhance scalability, interoperability, and usability within its three chains. If you want to explore and interact with the AXIA Ecosystem and DApps, you’ll need an AXIA Web Wallet.

## What is an AXIA Web Wallet? 
The AXIA Web Wallet is a non-custodial cryptocurrency browser wallet for interacting with the AXIA Ecosystem. You can store, transfer and stake AXIA Coins, and even create your own NFTs (non-fungible tokens) with the AXIA Web Wallet.
As mentioned, the AXIA Network features three types of blockchains: the SwapChain, AXChain and CoreChain. The SwapChain is a decentralized platform for creating and trading the AXIA Network's native token, AXIA Coin. The AXChain allows users to create smart contracts and interact with DApps and DeFi services. The CoreChain coordinates network Validators and can be used for staking through the AXIA Web Wallet.

## How does an AXIA Web Wallet work?
You can store AXIA Coins on any of the three chains to serve different purposes. Using AXIA Coin as an example: it can be stored and traded on the SwapChain, used on the AXChain to pay for transaction fees and interact with smart contracts, or staked on the CoreChain to generate rewards. This might sound complicated at first, but you can easily move tokens from one chain to another using the cross-chain function of the AXIA Web Wallet.
Note that each chain has its own wallet address and format. The SwapChain wallet addresses all start with “Swap” while the CoreChain addresses begin with “Core” and the AXChain addresses start with a “0,” which is similar to Ethereum addresses.

To transfer tokens to and from your AXIA Web Wallet, you should select the corresponding chain address. For example, MetaMask wallets are only compatible with the AXChain. Be careful and make sure to double-check the addresses before making transactions. Funds can be lost and permanently irretrievable if you send them to an incompatible network.
