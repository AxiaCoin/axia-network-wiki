The ideas of efficiency and productivity associated with free market capitalism are supposed to promote deflation. Through advancement in technology and other forms of innovation, free market capitalism is supposed to drive prices down while promoting economic growth. But prices keep rising as purchasing power is being stripped away. We have been led to believe that inflation is a good thing and deflation must be avoided at all costs. 

The desire for inflation makes no sense, especially if wages are not increasing at an equal or greater rate than inflation. Rising prices only work to lower the standard of living for most, increasing the barrier to entry to better our lives. However, this is the system that has been thrust upon society and the masses have been convinced to believe this is what is best for us. 

When the liquidity taps are turned on governments and central banks intervene in the economy by giving out cheap money, bailing out failing institutions and subsidizing risk. Cheap money and ample liquidity then supports demand, which causes both the rate of inflation and the price of assets to go up. This means most of us have to make do with less.

The rise in asset prices associated with liquidity measures is not based on productivity or real income growth. The result is higher asset prices with higher levels of debt, volatility, risk and speculation, leading to increasingly larger bubbles that will one day burst. With no increase in productivity we become prisoners of debt. And the debt does not work for us, we work for it - forever being its servant.

There needs to be a way for people to break free. Where the economy cannot be manipulated by the few, where there are no more zombie companies borrowing from our future to enrich themselves today, where the market is not fueled by speculation, but fundamentals due to increased productivity, where any sign of growing wealth inequality can be stemmed through actual market forces, where real opportunity to advance oneself is available to everyone.    

We must strive to live in a world where the economic forces in a free market - a real free market - determine our fate. That is when fairness is really achievable and prosperity can be distributed for all.   

Many central banks have a desire for inflation due to the fact that it causes the value of government debt to decrease. But there is a reason why inflation is considered a “hidden tax.” By increasing the supply of money it dilutes the currency, devaluing the purchasing power of a unit of currency. This means you get less for your money.

In low interest rate environments policymakers hope to stimulate the economy by essentially reallocating future economic activity into the present. This means we are stealing from our future selves and transferring welfare across generations. So, the impact goes down over time because all the activity has already occurred. 

Low interest rates encourage more borrowing, and more worrying low interest rates also disincentivize saving. Central banks incentivize more borrowing and more spending among the masses to boost activity  with their policies. Every cycle they rely on this process to a greater degree to trigger greater inflation.   

However, the one thing all central banks cannot currently control is what people are willing to spend - yet.
