The loss of purchasing power is happening all the time with no way for people to stop the decline. Fiat currency is not backed by anything; it can be created out of thin air in whatever amount. This lowers the purchasing power of money relative to what it can be exchanged for. This is what occurs every time a central bank expands the money supply. Money and credit becomes more easily available, leading some assets to appear like they are gaining value. The reality is that it is just the loss of purchasing power.

This loss of purchasing power can easily be measured by simply examining what any item costs today versus one, two, five, ten, fifty years ago. So keeping money in the bank or under the mattress will just lose value over time. This is why fiat currency is not sound money. So keeping traditional money as money is a good way to lose money.

When central banks print more money it is with the inclination to stimulate the economy to often keep it, or bring it out of recession. However, this always comes with the loss of purchasing power in the end. Therefore, currency competition may have a large upside for human welfare. It can provide the means for both a better concept of money, with the development of ideal monetary policies as well as a more practical implementation of monetary systems. 

The history of money suggests that there will always be a persistent demand for a non-sovereign issued currency that can act as a counterweight to the propensity for inflation from the fiat-based monetary system. If that demand were to become unrelenting it is highly likely some form of a private and/or decentralized alternative would emerge. 

Monopolies affect everyone. Therefore, the introduction of private and decentralized currencies should forego any attempt to have them strictly backed by the US dollar, Euro, Yen or any basket of these currencies. This would allow people to flock to alternatives and to protect their best interests should anything go awry with fiat currency. 

Even less reliable private or decentralized currencies in a free market are likely to be more reliable than that of a singular government monopoly currency. This is because private currencies will be under constant scrutiny by the market. The very survival of any private currency, and the issuing organization, will depend on meeting the demands of the market itself. In fact, its very survival hinges on free market factors. Beyond simply having a storage of value and being able to be used as a medium of exchange, a private currency could allow for new methods of efficiency as well as forms of value creation that otherwise are not possible. 

Fiat currency works in complete contrast to this, as governments constantly institute policies that devalue their respective currencies. Thus, a competitive free market benefits the people because private currencies would at the very least have to preserve value to not only remain coveted, but trusted by the public. Preferred currencies will take the largest share of the market and less desirable currencies will fade into the background. 

By virtue of working within a true, open and transparent free market, the public will have the ability to enact discipline on a private currency, preserving its value. In contrast, the public cannot easily or efficiently discipline a government issued currency due to the fact that the public has no say or control over the policies that continue the endless devaluation. The opportunity for people around the world to easily access the best currency would result in increased economic productivity. Therefore, the privatization and the decentralization of money is in the best interest of everyone.
