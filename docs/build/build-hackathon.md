## Join a Hackathon

AXIA Foundation regularly supports developer focused events! Be the first to know by signing
up for the [AXIA newsletter](https://AXIA.network/) - the footer has a link to sign up!

## Host a Hackathon

As one of our objectives in the AXIA Foundation is promoting the
[Web3 technology stack](https://github.com/axia-tech/General-Grants-Program/blob/master/grants/AXIA_stack.md)
, we would like to support any individual or team who wants to organize a hackathon that gets
more developers to understand AXIA and Substrate in your city or online.

We are not only providing technical resources for you, but we can have someone from our team give a
hands-on workshop/presentation about the technology to help participants get started hacking on it
more quickly.

### Why you should host a hackathon?

- Connect with the W3F team and larger community
- Support Web3 education, opportunities, and more
- Learn the bleeding-edge technology
- Make lasting impact and gain connections in the community

## How do hackathons differ from workshops?

Hackathons (AKA Buildathons) are aimed at participants who want to deliver their prototype and
demonstrate their ideas to reality in a short period (few hours - one day), or online in a few
weeks. Workshops are more for getting developers familiar with the tooling and understanding
more about what are the resources currently available and how they can make use of it.

## How can you run a hackathon in your city?

Get in touch with the W3F team by [email] or ask us via our
[Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#w3f:matrix.org) chat.
