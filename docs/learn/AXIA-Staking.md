Staking refers to the process of delegating a fixed amount of cryptocurrencies for a specified time frame in exchange for earning rewards. Staking has established itself as a viable way for people to generate rewards, unlike traditional banking.

AXIA has introduced staking programs at AXIA Capital Bank where the rewards and benefits provided to participants go well beyond what is available in the market today. Typically staking rewards are offered and compared in terms of an Annual Percentage Rate (APR). 

AXIA has commenced its staking program at AXIA Capital Bank by offering favorable rewards in terms of APR compared to industry standard. It should be noted that the staking rewards at AXIA Capital Bank are compounded daily, hence supercharging the stakeholdersâ€™ total rewards.

The longer a participant stakes their AXIA Coin at AXIA Capital Bank, the longer it will not be a part of the circulating supply. This is not only more advantageous for the AXIA Network due to the improved fundamentals, but the participants receive the benefit from a higher APR. The improved fundamentals go beyond just the fact that additional AXIA Coin are burned through staking. There is also the immediate boost from greater scarcity through the reduction of Total Supply as an equivalent amount of AXIA Coin are immediately burned once they are placed into a staking program. Furthermore, an equivalent amount of the rewards that are generated daily are also burned; and finally, at the end of the term an equivalent amount of AXIA Coin is also burned. All of this together simultaneously provides the benefits of a lower circulating supply for both the AXIA Network and all the participants. This can augment the benefits of the overall rewards that the participant receives from staking in a unique and highly favorable way. 

AXIA Capital Bank will offer several different coin staking terms, magnified by the power of daily compounding, as illustrated in the table below:
