The monetary policy of AXIA is controlled by code, not a few people in a boardroom. Unlike fiat currencies, AXIA has a limited total supply that has already been established which can only reduce over time.. There will never be more AXIA Coins minted than the Total Supply. And the Total Supply can only decrease, never increase. 


In addition to offering a more efficient and cost effective ability to move their AXIA Coins from wallet-to-wallet, across the globe, individual community members will be able to exchange their AXIA Coins for other global currencies should they wish to do so. In supporting these integration and partnership opportunities, the AXIA Foundation maintains a commitment to actively support a variety of use cases through innovative services, products and platforms so that global participants, businesses and projects continue to flourish within the community.

## Standard Method of Calculating Market Capitalization
While the Circulating Supply, Total Supply, Staked Supply and Burned Supply may vary at any one time, what is unequivocal, indisputable and immutable is that the Total Supply will never go up, only down. There will never be more coins minted than the Initial Total Supply.

Based on the Tokenomics of AXIA, the Market Capitalization is calculated based on the **Market Price x Circulating Supply**.

This calculation is the market standard method of calculating Market Capitalization.

So Total Supply, Staked Supply and Burned Supply do not contribute to the market capitalization calculation.

When a participant acquires AXIA Coin it can be taken from Total Supply. 

The total AXIA Coin exchanged will be determined based on this calculation:

Asset Value/AXIA Coin Market Price = Total AXIA Coin exchanged 

Any asset(s) that are exchanged for AXIA Coins are then transferred into the AXIA Treasury.

At the same time an equivalent amount of AXIA Coin is burned, thus increasing the Total Burned Supply.  Additionally should a participant choose to stake AXIA Coin this will increase the Total Staked Supply and raise the Total Burned Supply even more with a commensurate amount of AXIA Coin permanently removed from Total Supply. 

Individuals will be able to easily assess AXIA Coin data relative to alternatives. This is due to the overall transparency of information displayed to the market. It will simplify the capability to make informed decisions in the fraction of the time that it might take to draw conclusions about other projects. The fundamentals will speak for themselves.

## AXIA aims to remove the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies

AXIA Early Adopter AXIA Coins have been pre-committed to founding team members, strategic advisors and project funding participants prior to the AXIA Network Launch. AXIA aims to remove the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies by releasing clear-cut, real-time based figures to the world. AXIA is a project that is supported by a diverse international team that has professionalhas diverse professional backgrounds and experience in:such as: application development, blockchain and software engineering, finance, and marketing. AXIA is a self-funded project from the contributions of the early adopters. The funds contributed by early participants have been utilized to develop the network and the ever expanding AXIA Ecosystem consisting of applications and platforms available today and into the future. AXIA Coins from this pool will also be used for the upgrades, maintenance, administration and development of existing and new use cases, services and applications along with the implementation of the strategic partnerships and awareness campaigns that will assist to ensure the widespread adoption of the AXIA Network and AXIA Coin. AXIA will continue to promote a participatory inclusionary model inviting new participants to assist with new developments and the strategic direction of the overall AXIA Network.

The early adopters also ensured that any new participant is entering into a fully built and functioning network and ecosystem of ready to use applications for the advantage of everyone. Therefore, each new participant entering the AXIA Network will immediately work within the decentralized hyper-deflationary economic model that creates value for themselves and others.

The initial AXIA Treasury contributors, have a strong belief in the project vision and share the desire to create significant value and provide positive social impact around the world. Knowing the potential AXIA Coin can unleash, their motivation from the outset was to make AXIA Coin the most secure form of currency that has ever come into existence. Due to the commitment of the AXIA team and early adopters all have removed their allotment of AXIA Coins from circulation for the long-term staking program.
With a deep understanding of the participatory, inclusionary economic model, the individuals involved agreed to proceed with the development of the AXIA Real-Time Reporting Platform to have assets in the AXIA Treasury validated by third party accounting professionals. 
 
This represented a significant milestone towards the AXIA Treasury, already an established, verifiable, calculable value that would immediately support the project. 

This structure further fulfills the collective goal of bringing an even more favorable alternative to the market to encourage people from all over the world to participate, continually building the community and expanding the ecosystem. The more the community builds and its ecosystem expands, the more value stands to be created for everyone.
