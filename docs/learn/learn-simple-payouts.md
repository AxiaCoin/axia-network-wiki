AXIA is designed to be a distributed stakeholder model. Individuals who participate in AXIA do not just have the possession of AXIA Coin, but a stake in the network and the economy itself. The ecosystem is distributed for individuals and companies anywhere to reap the benefits. 
## Welcome to AXIA's Join Community

Where so many are shut out in the traditional paradigm, AXIA welcomes all to join its community.The AXIA Network offers the gateway to deliver the value to its participants, but it is the participant who creates the value that is delivered.There is no single person, corporation or government in control of AXIA. AXIA exists for the people to give people and companies extraordinary opportunities that have never existed before. AXIA is all about participation, inclusion and opportunity for all, as well as bringing about prosperity in unprecedented ways. The more people participate, the more prosperity is generated.  

In AXIA, the wealthy are incentivized to help those that are less fortunate, knowing they will only propel the AXIA Network forward, and deliver that much more value back to themselves. As barriers to entry continue to increase, it becomes more difficult for those who are not wealthy to advance. They cannot protect themselves against loss of purchasing power in fiat currency by accumulating financial assets. Those assets are how individuals hedge against loss of value in currency. It is often an illusion that these assets have greater worth when in reality it may only be due to the fact that the value is measured against a loss of purchasing power. AXIA opens the door to bring more people into the system.  

## When a User Becomes a Stakeholder
With AXIA as soon as a user becomes a participant in the AXIA Community they reduce the Total Supply of AXIA Coin and if they stake and / or are active  it will lead to even  more value as the coin becomes more rare. It goes well beyond a network effect with a built in incentive due to the hyper-deflationary design g.e. Each time  participation, staking and activity taking place it will only create more demand for AXIA Coin against the lowering supply of coins. Therefore, the benefits can be amplified through this constant creating value.
As participants create value for others, value is being delivered directly back to themselves in an instantaneous manner.

## AXIA The Perpetual Motion Machine
AXIA empowers people to improve their life circumstances, while at the same time improve the lives of others.The AXIA Network is analogous to a perpetual motion machine. It just keeps moving forward, but the pace will continue to accelerate building momentum, increasing velocity and getting more powerful over time. Each participant has a stake;  every use case in the ecosystem, every business, every single activity that occurs all deliver ongoing value in which the rewards only continue to grow while simultaneously building more and more foundational strength to AXIA Coin. This is all distributed across an open transparent economy for the benefit of everyone.
