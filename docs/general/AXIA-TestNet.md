Several applications and platforms have been made  available for the AXIA project prior to the launch of the AXIA Network. The AXIA Network will serve as the foundation for the complete Ecosystem.

The AXIA Network is now officially in TestNet. The project team is now inviting developers to join the community to continue to expand the ecosystem and develop more and more partnerships. 

Upon launch of the AXIA Network (MainNet) the current AXIA Coin (AXC) ERC-20 token will be replaced in a seamless fashion by the superior AXIA Coin (AXC). This coin, the native coin of the AXIA Network, will offer so much more for the AXIA community and for all the participants today and tomorrow.
