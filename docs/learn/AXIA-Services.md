There are a variety of services and products available as part of the AXIA Ecosystem that participants can take advantage of right away. These services and products offer greater convenience, efficiency and autonomy, along with favorable benefits and rewards. All of this, while providing even greater real-world utility for AXIA Coin in its ever-expanding ecosystem and network.

### AXIA Secure Key Storage and Token Custody Service

The self-management and recovery of a user’s public and private wallet keys is a clear challenge slowing the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies. Some of the main concerns of using cryptocurrencies relate to the ease of use of wallet applications and overall security of funds. If a user’s keys are lost, forgotten or in some cases stolen, their cryptocurrencies and funds are gone forever.

Because of the deficiencies that currently exist, the implementation of AXIA Key Storage and Token Custody Services through a connected wallet application is invaluable. AXIA has developed its very own key storage model that incorporates state-of-the-art data encryption to protect a user at all times from potential system attacks that could jeopardize their keys, while also stopping them from falling into the wrong hands. Additionally, AXIA has implemented an account creation mechanism in which a user’s public and private keys are tied to a self-selected email address and their system password can always be re-generated if needed, ensuring they will never lose access to their funds. Now, AXIA Coin holders can recover their existing key(s) if lost or forgotten.

Registering a wallet within the AXIA Network and Ecosystem offers a user the ability to securely store their AXIA Coins. This can be done so safely, while still having the ability to immediately send, transfer, exchange and spend the same digital currency. 

The AXIA custody solution meets and exceeds enterprise-scale custody services that are typically only offered to some digital exchanges, investment funds or other institutional-sized clients who pass along the costs for third-party management to individual users. AXIA has specifically integrated its own custody service to allow all AXIA participants – irrespective of wealth or status – to utilize this advanced infrastructure seamlessly for free. The AXIA Foundation will incur any associated custody costs on behalf of the user directly, while the user remains in control of their own spendable AXIA Coin while they are securely stored.

The storage solution is considered very secure and virtually unhackable. The user can implement multiple factors of authentication to protect themselves, even if someone were to steal their phone or compromise their desktop application. 


### AXIA CAPITAL BANK

Currently, the ability to hold a bank account is a privilege. AXIA Capital bank can lead the path towards making this a human right. AXIA Capital Bank was brought into existence to provide a more inclusionary bank for people around the globe. One of the main objectives of AXIA Capital Bank is to bring an end to the unbanked.

So deposits are taken offline and cannot be hacked as they could be through a centralized bank, even if a phone gets stolen or a computer gets hacked.

AXIA Capital Bank ensures all AXIA Coin users always have visibility, access and control of their custodied coins.
