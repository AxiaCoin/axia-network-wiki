### Dashboard
If you connect to the public networks, the default configuration for your node will connect it to the public [Telemetry](https://telemetry.test.axiacoin.network) service.

You can verify that your node is connected by navigating to the correct network on the dashboard and finding the name of your node.

There is a built-in search function on the nodes page. Simply start typing keystrokes in the main window to make it available.

### Here you can see how our local AXIA node is shown in the Telemetry:
