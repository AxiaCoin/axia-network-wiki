## Security

The AXIA Network is fulfilling the goal of ensuring that security is fault tolerant. The stakeholders of the network select a limited set of Validators that have the majority (more than 67%) of responsible and reliable participating members which in turn allows them to author the next block. That figure should be far exceeded, as it is rather the bare minimum threshold. The elected Validators are responsible for assisting with maintaining the CoreChain.The AXIA Network will remain highly scalable due to the fact that the number of Validators for each of the AllyChain can be kept small. However, due to the high backing of Validators, the PoP ensures that any attack on AXIA is so cost prohibitive that it is virtually impossible to occur. Each AllyChain can maintain the highest level of security knowing that it is backed by the entire AXIA Network itself. 


In a larger context, the AXIA Network offers greater security to AllyChains as the total amount of AllyChains in conjunction with the total amount of staked AXIA Coin will combine together as a sum versus each singular blockchain standing alone.


It is important and beneficial for all Validators to have a stake of significant size. A favorable and flexible reward scheme for both Nominators and Validators guarantees that the participation remains high in every PoP consensus round and only continues to grow following each and every round. Furthermore, there is reassurance that the stake of the Validators are evenly distributed.


Validators are rewarded or punished against each consensus round that is executed. The AXIA Network makes certain that there is reasonable, transparent and trustworthy behavior as any punishment of a Validator is also passed on to the Nominators, who elected them.


Updates may be needed for the logic of the CoreChain which will be driven by the community. The governance model of the AXIA Network promotes decentralized decision making as any changes or updates cannot be made by central authorities, a small team or organization and as such invites the AXIA Community, coin users and developers to be an active part of the process.


As seen frequently with existing blockchains, continuous code updates lead to an impasse and/or a permanent fork. The AXIA Network balances being able to make consensus driven changes in a form of general agreement with significant speed while also being able to deal with less prefered options. The primary adjudicators on the network are the AXIA Coin holders as they participate through state weighted governance to decide upon any code changes. Therefore, there is no manner that changes can be made when not elected by the majority. 

## Cryptography
The AXIA Network uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) to secure node to node communication. TLS is a well proven standard for the Internet and is an efficient mix of both symmetric key cryptography and public key encryption.
