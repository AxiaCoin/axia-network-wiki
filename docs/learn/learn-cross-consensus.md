## AXIA Tokenomics
AXIA is introducing a proprietary monetary model that combines a number of economic features that provide unique benefits to participants and holders of the AXIA Coin. 

AXIA is the first ever hyper-deflationary asset supported digital currency that provides real-time transparency of its treasury holdings. The AXIA Treasury has been established to give additional support to AXIA Coin and its holders. 

The unique combination of a coin supply that reduces through coin burning from activities such as participating and staking, along with the treasury that can grow with total visibility to the market enables the enhancement of the purchasing power of the AXIA Coin. The  proprietary tokenomic design is enabled by a variety of smart contracts built into the AXIA project.

Wherever possible, third-parties have been utilized to review, report and audit on the viability of the economics, the reporting tools utilized and smart contracts put in place to ensure security, reliability and credibility is always in place.
## AXIA Coin Burning
The coin burning mechanism is facilitated from a variety of inputs that will only increase in velocity as the AXIA Ecosystem continues to expand. This hyper-deflationary aspect of the economic design

The AXIA Coin Burning Smart Contract ensures that coins are burned from the Total Supply when any of the following four events happens:
1. A purchase of AXIA Coin inside the AXIA Ecosystem
2. When an AXIA Coin is placed in a staking pool
3. At the end of the staking term when an AXIA Coin is released from the pool
4. When an activity in the ecosystem generates an eligible fee.  For example:  
    * Upon use of an AXIA debit card, the associated transaction fee is generated and the equivalent amount of that fee is burned.  
    * If a user generates fees through the use of an ecosystem app or platform such as AXplorer or AXclusive, then the equivalent amount is burned.
5. As earnings are generated from the AXIA Ecosystem applications, platforms and businesses as well as from associated partnerships, a corresponding amount of AXIA coins will be burned based on the USD value being placed into the AXIA Treasury.  

With this structure, AXIA Coins will constantly be burned with virtually every interaction or activity within the ecosystem as the AXIA Treasury can be increasing simultaneously, consistently enhancing value for AXIA Coin holders over time. All this is occurring through the decentralized activity of the AXIA participants. Going forward, additional coin burning trigger events may be added if deemed appropriate. 

With this design there is assurance that AXIA Coin will increase the rate of coin burning over time ensuring that the coin becomes more and more scarce, providing consistent value to AXIA community members. This constant reduction in supply not only can strengthen purchasing power, but exemplifies how the economic model of the AXIA Coin is anti-dilutive. This is the complete contrast to the alternative currencies that institute a monetary policy in which there is the capacity to mint more currency whether by a centralized organization or based on specified parameters in decentralized systems. This means the total supply of these instruments are essentially infinite; whether they be fiat currency or cryptocurrency.

Monetary theorists have proposed that minting / printing more currency increases productivity for an economy. As explained this has been proven false specifically by the debt based sovereign currency models that are in place today. Additionally, this has not removed the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies. Though there have been many advancements in technology over the last decades, productivity has not grown in proportion. 

Inflationary monetary policies where currency can be minted at any time in whatever amount, have proven that not only will there be a loss of purchasing power, hence value, but there is minimal or no significant increase in productivity. It establishes a system of wealth concentration and unfairness. In the case of sovereign currencies a dependence on debt. 

The architecture of the AXIA tokenomics is specifically based on having a model that increases productivity and prosperity for all in an equitable manner. Where there will be opportunity for all individuals to advance themselves and improve the life of others as well as increase efficiency and productivity for businesses. 
## Staking 
The AXIA Staking Model is unique in the industry. It is designed to generate rewards for participants providing additional value while also ensuring there is protection regardless of market scenarios. The rewards are calculated based on a proprietary approach utilizing the AXC/USD exchange rate.

For example, should there be an increase in the exchange rate for AXIA Coin, then the previous rewards earned are worth more. There is also an additional value and a built-in hedge if there was ever a decrease in the exchange rate, as there would be more rewards distributed to the participants to safeguard against this. Therefore, the potential for compounding the rewards is even greater due to the fact that the AXIA Coin holders would accumulate more rewards augmenting the compounding effect.  

This unique value proposition provides benefit to AXIA Coin stakers regardless of changes in exchange rate throughout the staking term.
## AXIA Treasury
Whenever coins are purchased directly from the AXIA Capital Bank or elsewhere within the AXIA Ecosystem, the AXIA Treasury increases according to that purchase value. Moreover, the Total Supply is reduced by the corresponding amount of coins. If there is an associated fee it grows the Treasury that much more and further enhances the reduction of the total supply from that one singular instance. 

Any fiat capital or cryptocurrency used to acquire that coin is deposited into the Treasury.   Earnings generated from any of the AXIA platforms, applications or businesses as well as associated partnerships within the ecosystem are also deposited into the AXIA Treasury. The Treasury will have the means to consistently grow as the ecosystem continues to expand thus providing greater support and strength for AXIA Coin. 

## Enhancement of Purchasing Power
Part of the monetary policy of AXIA is to ensure constant enhancement of the purchasing power of AXIA Coin is in place for all participants. 
 
The unique attributes of the AXIA tokenomics is that they are designed to support an evaluation multiple (market capitalization determined by the market) of the overall value of the AXIA Treasury. The fact that the Treasury will always increase over time while there will be the constant decrease of the Total Supply of AXIA Coin provides not only fundamental value, but the justification and reasoning as to how to determine the value of the AXIA Coin itself. Especially relative to other alternatives whether they be sovereign issued currency or other cryptocurrencies that simply cannot compete with this superior monetary system and economic model. 

Therefore, the AXIA Coin market capitalization should never be at the equivalent value to the Treasury.  It is designed to always be at a multiple based on future value due to the understanding that the Total Supply will always be decreasing while the AXIA Treasury can increase. 

Because of all these mechanisms for decreasing supply and increasing Treasury, it should result in a multiplier effect on the value of the AXIA Coin regardless of market conditions. The tokenomics of AXIA Coin are completely uncorrelated to the global market and economy and act as protective tools during periods of market turmoil. 

Although this would be considered an arbitrage or market inefficiency should the market capitalization fall below the total value of the AXIA Treasury, the AXIA Foundation will begin to acquire coins that will be burned reducing the supply as a protective measure for AXIA Coin holders. This process will begin should the market capitalization ever fall below 12.5% of the AXIA Treasury value.  This policy has been instituted as a protective measure for AXIA participants to ensure there is always market and price integrity in the price of AXIA Coin. This process will continue until such time that the market capitalization and AXIA Treasury are valued at par and remain in place to re-establish the multiplier effect. 

Unlike other projects, the AXIA Treasury does not include the value associated with the AXIA Coin itself.  This is a key differentiator as only verifiable deposits captured within the Real Time Reporting Platform are included in the calculation of the value of the AXIA Treasury.  This is another manner in which AXIA stands alone in the industry in terms of providing greater underlying support and value for the actual coin and the ecosystem. 

Other alternative projects that have a treasury neither display or utilize their treasury holdings in this manner.  The market value of these projects is rather based on the “perceived value” of the token or coin at any time and whatever vertical service offerings they have within that project.  AXIA is different.  Although economic value is provided throughout the entire ecosystem through the various apps and platforms, as well as the unique economic design, it is not part of the total sum displayed by the AXIA Treasury.  This further exemplifies why there should be a multiplier effect on the market capitalization versus the AXIA Treasury in place at all times.
