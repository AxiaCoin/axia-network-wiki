The U.S. dollar has been a global reserve currency since 1920 and has been unrivaled since World War Two. This hegemony gives an incredible privilege to the United States.
The fact that the U.S. dollar is the reference currency that is used for international trade means it will always be in large demand and be that much more liquid than other currencies.
The gold standard proved to be too inconvenient for governments inclined to spend other people’s money. The gold standard caps spending based on the total value of gold in reserve. There simply is not enough gold to make up for all the spending that the average politician wants to do. They will quickly run out. They can try to issue debt using gold as collateral, but there is a limit to that as well because eventually the debtor will grow wary of the ability to repay.

## Previous Monetary System

Fiat currencies — or currencies by government decree — are extremely convenient for politicians. Fiat currencies can always be inflated. Well, that is until hyperinflation takes over, and there is so much money in circulation that it becomes essentially worthless. But, up until that point, fiat currencies are very useful to politicians, as most of the time it is a way of just kicking the can down the street so the next politician will have to deal with the eventual dire consequences.
When the Federal Reserve increases the money supply it exports inflation out to the rest of the world based on the dominance of the current reserve currency. So the Federal Reserve is affecting the entire global monetary and financial system.   
The constant monetary expansion devalues the U.S. dollar reducing purchasing power which acts as a hidden tax to all the citizens of the world.
Gold provided a store of value that protected the purchasing power of the public, but no one can escape the constant depreciation of fiat currency.
This infinite monetary expansion leads to more instability in our societies and in the global economy. It makes the rich even richer, but leaves the rest in ever-more difficult circumstances.
So many of the problems of the world - unfairness, inequality, oppression and misfortune - can be traced back to that fateful day on August 15, 1971 when Nixon announced to the world that the United States was closing the gold window. 
Though Nixon is best known for the Watergate scandal, this was the most wide ranging and long-standing impact of his presidency. The effects are still being felt today.
The devastating consequences of the endless printing of fiat money has led to an eruption of debt for individuals, companies and governments alike. Banking crises occur with greater frequency and larger intensity. Volatility in the markets is wider ranging and more violent than ever before. Wealth inequality is at an all time high and getting worse by the day.
Politicians running governments take advantage of the system by borrowing greater and greater amounts of money. The current system is built on the idea that debts will never stop growing. It will never be reduced, it will just keep expanding.
Since the economic crisis of 2008, the situation has only worsened because the central banks have continuously expanded the money supply to gloss over the fundamental problems that lie beneath.  
These fundamental problems do not get solved, they just get hidden with temporary distractions from the inevitable collapse.

## Current Monetary System
The pandemic-led economic crisis of 2020 was only a continuation of the 2008 crisis and our reliance on a model of debt fueled economic growth. The significant increase in debt in the 2000’s contributed to the Global Financial Crisis in 2008, and within a few years global debt resumed its precipitous climb. Since the end of 2019, the period just prior to the pandemic, global debt has risen by almost 40 percentage points to 360 percent of global GDP. Further debt accumulation to drive growth has only delayed the inevitable consequences we face in the future because of what was never dealt with in the past. 
Things are no different in the private sector. Individual and corporate debts have exploded in size across the globe. 
As debts increase it fuels overconsumption leading to rising prices of assets. The larger the debt loads become, the more public debt will eventually be when the fall materializes. The concerning issue is that the public debt will not be used for productive things, it is used as a catalyst to try and lift up the economy and prevent it from falling further.

On the surface this sounds positive, but when debt is used for unproductive investments, the result is that debt is unlikely to be repaid. In such cases one of the more frequently employed strategies is to just inflate it away. However, the more unproductive investments that there are in the economy, the more the debt is needed to curb the next downtown as each dollar of newly issued debt has less impact in creating growth due to loss of purchasing power. 
The unlimited expansion of the fiat money supply is at the heart of the problems with the current system. Not only is the Federal Reserve buying U.S. Treasury bonds, allowing the government to increase debt even more, they are expanding their balance sheet, increasing the supply of money to buy all kinds of assets today.
This completely perverts the market, only adding to the volatility, along with creating massive bubbles.
There is no free market anymore. Bailouts are given to businesses favoured by bankers and government, passing over medium, small and micro business. Companies that should have failed long ago are repeatedly thrown lifelines.Those same companies become zombies draining the economy of innovation, productivity and future economic growth.
Free markets are supposed to cleanse the business community of the failed and flawed. Like nature, free markets should purge that which does not adapt from the system. This may seem harsh, but at least it's honest.
What the continuous printing of money has done is exponentially increase debt at all levels, while wealth inequality explodes. The market becomes more risky as bank and economic crises become more frequent. More barriers to entry for the public continue to grow, as people struggle under more difficult conditions along with the escalation of unfairness and injustice for many.
