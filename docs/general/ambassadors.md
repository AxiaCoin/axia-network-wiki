 “It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.” - Henry Ford
# Bank influence on our lives
Excessive risk taking by banks led to such severe losses in 1982 and 2008 and proved to have extreme and dire long-term consequences where the negative impacts are still being felt by most today. Yet the system remains, as the bankers remain rich. Prior to each cataclysmic loss these bankers stated that there were no signs of any notable outstanding risks. How can we allow for this system that is so fraught with obvious defects to have such a profound influence on our lives?

# How central banks is to prevent bank failures ?
Central banks exist for one purpose only. Many think that the purpose is the management of the money supply and inflation. However, in actual fact, the reason for central banks is to prevent bank failures. 

Banks operate in fractional reserve by extending credit and loaning out more money than they have  on deposit. Financial institutions running fractional reserves would increase the expectation of profit through leverage. So, to stay competitive all banks have to follow suit, which means more and more loans are issued. With the increased volume of loans, the quality of the loans gets reduced. And because leverage can swing both ways, it increases the risk significantly for the banks. This is why banks have balance sheet risk at all times.

If there was any sign of instability in a bank system, people would lose trust. The banks would not be able to pay back all the depositors, and would be forced into bankruptcy. This is what is described as a bank run. When that happens, remaining deposits would disappear instantly. But this is based on the assumption of a free market which has not been the case for decades.      

 Central banks prevent bank runs by acting as the lender of last resort. In practice this amounts to central banks bailing financial institutions out of excessive and misplaced risk taking, creating moral hazard.
# Tokenize Our Assets 
Today however, thanks to technological advancements, the possibility exists to digitize or tokenize our assets into entirely new models outside the banking framework. This can be accomplished while still being able to access the same suite of services that are offered by the bank. These services can be provided to the public while reducing both the friction and costs associated with the current financial system, and at the same time can remove the considerable risk that exists within the banking industry. Yet the fractional banking system sustains its dominance on the market.
