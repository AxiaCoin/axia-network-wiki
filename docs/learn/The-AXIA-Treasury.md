The purpose of the AXIA Treasury is to provide an even greater safeguard and reinforce the benefits of the AXIA Network with an additional layer of support for the network and AXIA Coin users themselves. The benefits of the network and AXIA Coin are enhanced by the ability to consistently expand the AXIA Treasury. The holdings held in the AXIA Treasury are made transparent to the public in real-time, at all times, and are always verified through the AXIA Real-Time-Reporting Platform. 

Based on the AXIA Real-Time-Reporting Platform, which will be available to view through a web dashboard on the AXIA website, AXIA Coin has established a far more transparent and trustworthy medium of exchange.

The AXIA Treasury will vary in size and volume over time, however the Total Supply of AXIA Coins can only decrease The key objective of the AXIA Treasury is to provide greater balance and stability.

AXIA is nothing like a ‘direct-peg’ model used by stablecoins or traditional asset-backed structures. AXIA will not attempt to operate as either a synthetic (artificially manipulated) or fiat-like dollar. Instead, AXIA will utilize the ever-expanding decentralized AXIA Network and Ecosystem, along with the ATL, to expand the AXIA Treasury while decreasing Total Supply of AXIA Coins to provide a superior economic model  that can offer greater transparency that is unprecedented for a digital currency, let alone any currency for that matter. 

As the AXIA Network and AXIA Ecosystem continue to expand, so too does the ability for the AXIA Treasury to expand and add even more support for AXIA Coin and the network. 

A corresponding amount of AXIA Coin will be burned based on the changes in the total holding within the AXIA Treasury. This means that not only the support in strength increases with the expansion of the AXIA Treasury, but it is further enhanced due to the immediate reduction in Total Supply.

The ATL acts as the link between AXIA Coin and the AXIA Treasury to create additional efficiency, building off the participation and collaborative activities in the community. Anything that is transparent to the market, meets the stringent standards of the AXIA Real-Time Reporting Platform, and can be easily evaluated and verified by external auditors, nodes or the market itself, can be used for an additional layer of support. The benefit of this design is that AXIA Coin can potentially remove any correlation to any one currency, commodity, market or economy. This results in the potential to provide a more secure and a better alternative for a currency than what has been established to date.
