AXIA offers a suite of free, ready-to-use applications all incorporating the embedded AXpay wallet that enhances tokenization, commercialization and reward possibilities related to the AXIA Network applications through day-to-day use, providing them with greater utility than alternatives.  
### AXplorer
AXplorer is a free, private and secure online web browser where individuals can confidently surf the internet without being tracked. To enhance the security and privacy to an even greater degree, AXplorer comes with the built-in AXshield proxy extension.

AXplorer will also make it easy for users to earn rewards while visiting all of their favorite websites by allowing them to opt into a benefits program where they are able to tokenize their browsing data. Users can decide for themselves whether they want to turn data sharing off and browse in private mode or activate the AXplorer data sharing rewards system, which results in receiving AXIA rewards deposited directly into the AXpay wallet after meeting specified requirements. Furthermore, users will also eventually have the potential to earn additional rewards by watching selected videos and ads, visiting suggested websites and responding to short questionnaires. 

AXplorer has all the same characteristics as the most commonly used desktop and mobile web browsers and provides the same access to all public websites that users can visit online, but they can do so in a more private and secure manner while  giving them the ability to be in control of their own data. AXplorer can be synced across all individuals devices including phones, computers and tablets. 

### AXchat
AXchat is a free and encrypted messaging app where users can chat, make voice and video calls on desktop or mobile all while generating rewards for its daily use. 

Users can send and receive messages, photos, videos, files and voice notes freely, easily and securely. Individuals can also make voice and video calls to people all around the world at no cost when in WiFi zones. Users can connect one-on-one or create groups, and can import contacts from their phone or find people who are already using AXchat automatically. They can also sync AXchat across all their devices whether they be a phone, computer or tablet. This allows users to use multiple devices at the same time. 

Security is of the highest priority, so AXchat supports end-to-end encryption for messaging and voice notes, as well as both voice and video calls.
