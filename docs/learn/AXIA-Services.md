There are a variety of services and products available as part of the AXIA Ecosystem which participants can take advantage of right away. These services and products offer greater convenience, efficiency and autonomy, along with favorable benefits and rewards. All of this, while providing even greater real-world utility for AXIA Coin in its ever expanding ecosystem and network.

### AXIA SECURE KEY STORAGE AND TOKEN CUSTODY SERVICE

The self-management and recovery of a user’s public and private wallet keys is a clear challenge slowing the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies. Some of the main concerns of using cryptocurrencies relate to the ease of use of wallet applications, and overall security of funds. If a user’s keys are lost, forgotten, or in some cases stolen, their cryptocurrencies and funds are gone forever.

This is why the AXIA Key Storage and Token Custody Service, connected wallet application, is invaluable. AXIA has implemented its very own key storage model that incorporates state-of-the-art data encryption to protect a user at all times from potential system attacks that could jeopardize their keys, and stops them from falling into the wrong hands. Additionally, AXIA has implemented an account creation mechanism where a user’s public and private keys are tied to a self-selected email address and their system password can always be re-generated if needed ensuring they will never lose access to their funds. Now, AXIA Coin holders can recover their existing key(s) if lost or forgotten.

Registering within the AXIA public blockchain network and ecosystem offers a user the ability to securely store their AXIA Coins in a wallet. A user can securely store their AXIA Coins while still having the ability to immediately send, transfer, exchange and spend their digital currency. 

The AXIA custody solution meets and exceeds enterprise-scale custody services that are typically only offered to some digital exchanges, investment funds or other institutional-sized clients who pass along the costs for third party management to the individual users. AXIA has specifically integrated its own custody service to allow all AXIA participants – irrespective of wealth or status – to utilize this advanced infrastructure seamlessly for free. The AXIA Foundation will incur any associated custody costs on behalf of the user directly, while the user remains in control of their own spendable AXIA Coin while they are securely stored.

The storage solution is considered very secure and virtually unhackable. The user can implement multiple factors of authentication to protect themselves, even if someone were to steal their phone or compromise their desktop application. 


### AXIA CAPITAL BANK

Currently, the ability to hold a bank account is a privilege. AXIA Capital bank can lead the path towards making this a human right.

With its available custodial services, AXIA Capital Bank is able to offer free cold storage.
